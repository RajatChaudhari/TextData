I’d managed to convince myself not to worry but, last month, a friend announced that she, too, was engaged — and they’re having a New Year wedding. Now everyone keeps asking me when mine is. The whole thing is just making my insecurities worse. Why is he taking so long to set a date?

It was previously believed that a stratified social structure was necessary to enable the construction of large public buildings or monuments. At least 580 people - men, women and children - were buried at the site in Eastern Africa millennia ago, according to archaeologists. The cemetery - near Lake Turkana, in modern day Kenya - is the earliest and largest monumental cemetery The construction of such a big project contradicts long-standing beliefs about early complex societies.  The international research team, which included experts from Stony Brook University in New York, say that the Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery. They believe it was constructed and used over a period of several centuries, between about 5,000 and 4,3...   \n",

The aircraft has now been up for 340 days as part of it's latest trip, called the Orbital Test Vehicle-5 (OTV-5), which started on September 7th 2017. The craft was launched from Elon Musk's SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.  Officials have revealed few details about the OTV-5 mission but there has been a suggestion it could be part of a push for a US Space Force.  Scroll down for video The space plane is 29 feet (8.8 metres) long, 9.6 feet (2.9 metres) tall and weighs around 11,000 lbs.

Danielle Cooper, from Berkshire, revealed that when she fell pregnant with her first child in 2011, she put on three stone and tipped the scales at 13st 9Ibs. The 30-year-old, who works at a supermarket head office, continued to pile on the pounds when she gave birth to her son in 2015, wearing a size 16-18.

       "199  On first viewing I thought Fabian Schar's challenge on Marcos Alonso was a penalty but, after watching a replay, the Newcastle defender does get a touch on the ball. Does this mean it is not a penalty? No, there is a difference between getting a touch and dispossessing a player. Schar uses a scissor motion to make the tackle and it is his second leg which is guilty of the foul, and it is a foul. So yes, I support the decision of Paul Tierney, although I understand why it will split opinion. This is one of those where even the use of VAR would not be definitive and would still lead to debate. As for Newcastle's goal, it should not have stood. DeAndre Yedlin clearly uses his arm in the face of Olivier Giroud and, for me, did so deliberately. This should have been spotted and a foul awarded before the cross is made for Joselu to score.  If referee Anthony Taylor had use of VAR then I have no doubt he would have sent off Etienne Capoue. It is a jump, not a tackle, and he comes down on ...   \n",

Nadia Kheider, from Egypt's Antiquities Ministry, revealed the skeletons belong to a woman in her early 20s, a man in his late 30s and a man in his early 40s. The female was relatively short, measuring between 5 foot 3 inches and 5 foot 5 inches (160 to 164 cm) tall and the youngest male was only marginally bigger. The eldest of the skeletons is also by far the largest, measuring an impressive 6 foot tall (181 cm).  One of the males had a small hole in the back of his head that was originally thought to be an arrow wound but the researchers now think it as a result of 'surgical intervention' and the person lived for some time after the drastic procedure.

When he sent the girl, named Emilia, the sonnet 'about a first love' she'd asked for,  included dramatic lines like 'she places hand to chest with heart a-blaze,' and 'love lost is better than a love not shared'.  But when Drew, thought to be in the US, told her to look closely at the first letter of each line, she soon realised it spelled the words: 'Send nudes'. There was even a second hidden message - the first letter of the second word in each line spelled out: 'Phone number pls'.

When Manchester United fans attempt a similar stunt ahead of the game against Burnley next Sunday, the club's manager, Jose Mourinho, will not be the headline act.

       "22   For a few fleeting moments, the iPhone 8 was the flagship of the range, the best phone Apple has ever made. However, just moments after its introduction at the Steve Jobs Theater last week, Tim Cook revealed the iPhone X, with its futuristic looks and claim to be 'the future of the iPhone'. But don't be fooled -  for many the iPhone 8 will be the perfect handset, the 'iPhone classic' of the range, and a phone you really shouldn't write off. Scroll down for video  In fact, it’s got pretty much the the same internals as the X, but with the more familiar screen (and fingerprint sensor). It’s all about options - and the iPhone 8 is a really great one, an ‘iPhone classic’, if you will. While from the front, the phone looks absolutely identical to the 7 series, once you pick it up, the huge number of changes Apple has made become apparent. First, there’s the new glass back, which is on both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. While looking lovely (especially in the gold colour, which is actually fa...   \n",

From hooded 1970s hairdryers and his-and-hers matching outfits, and a dressing that doubled up as a bedspread, these hilarious vintage product listings from yesteryear show just how much Britain's tastes and trends have changed over the years. A spokesperson for Argos said: 'Since it first launched in 1973, the Argos catalogue has been a social barometer of the nation's changing tastes, habits and interests.  'A delve into our archive is a fascinating experience, revealing how technology, home décor, fashion trends and leisure pursuits have evolved over the years.

       "56   The world's largest shipping company is trialling a 'shortcut' trade route through the Arctic as global warming thaws open the infamous Northeast Passage. Danish firm Maersk announced it is sending a new ship loaded with a reinforced hull and a capacity of 3,600 containers into the polar sea for the first time. The container vessel, dubbed Venta Maersk, will travel between the cities of St Petersburg and Vladivostok over the top of Russia. Experts say it could reduce the most commonly used East Asia-Europe route via the Suez Canal from 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometres) to 8,000 miles (12,800 kilometres), cutting transit time by 10-15 days. Typically vessels taking this icy route have required an ice-breaker escort, but rising global temperatures are making the passage easier to traverse.

       "175  Jose Mourinho proclaimed himself 'a club man' who has never been selfish in his career as he faced up to an escalating crisis at Manchester United. The problems surrounding Mourinho that have spilled over from a difficult summer on tour and in the transfer market are in danger of overshadowing United's start to the season. An unconvincing opening win at home to Leicester was followed by a surprise defeat at Brighton last weekend, and Mourinho is a manager under pressure going into Monday's crucial game against Tottenham at Old Trafford. Another setback this early in the season would inevitably turn up the heat on the 55-year-old and his executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has not escaped the flak for the issues affecting the club. Crucially, the fans have yet to turn on Mourinho, even though some have paid to fly a protest banner against Woodward over Turf Moor when United play at Burnley on Sunday. The manager welcomed their support, but insisted it was for the sake of the te...   \n",
       "10   Droughts across Europe has caused hidden messages carved on rocks to warn of 'hard times ahead' to reappear. Known as 'hunger stones', they are reappearing in the Elbe River. Over a dozen of the hunger stones, chosen to record low water levels, can now be seen in and near the northern Czech town of Decin near the German border. The low water levels in the river that begins in the Czech Republic then crosses Germany into the North Sea has exposed stones on the river bed whose appearances in history used to warn people that hard times were coming. The oldest water mark visible on the river dates to 1616.  That stone, is considered the oldest hydrological landmark in Central Europe, bears a chiseled inscription in German that says: 'When you see me, cry.' On other rivers,  hunger stones go back to the 15th century, and inscriptions from 1417, 1473, 1616, 1654 and 1666 have been found.  In the second half of the 19th century, they entered the general consciousness after mentions in new...   \n",

'It's funny but it's not actually true,' chuckles Ben. 'We heard a new one this week: 'What do you call a curry in the England canteen? … Tom'.'

       "227  Ian Poulter and Paul Casey will both need wildcards if they are to play for Europe in the Ryder Cup in Paris next month.  Their final chance to make the team by right came and went when both finished down the field in the first of the FedEx Cup play-off events on the PGA Tour. Both needed a minimum of a top-20 finish in the Northern Trust to displace Thorbjorn Olesen in the last automatic spot, but neither came close after final rounds of 69 for Poulter and 74 for Casey. In theory, they could make a late dash and play in the Made in Denmark tournament this week, which is the final qualifying event. In reality, both will be in Boston for the second FedEx play-off tournament, which does not count. That event, however, will be completed before captain Thomas Bjorn names his four wildcards on September 5, so Poulter and Casey will have one final chance to impress, as will two more on the outside looking in — Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Swede Henrik Stenson.

Scientists found that soil in one of the world's coldest regions remained mushy and damp throughout the most recent winter. During these months the soil normally freezes over, forming a protective layer over Arctic permafrost that houses billions of tonnes of ancient carbon. Scientists warned that without this insulation, the permafrost will begin to melt, potentially releasing a dangerous payload of carbon dioxide and methane.

They say the bricks are the starting point to building up a permanent lunar outpost and breaking explorers' reliance on Earth supplies.

Scroll down for video  The blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) is a type of parrot known for their intelligence and verbal skills. In a new study, researchers observed five hand-reared captive macaws as they interacted with each other and with their human caretakers.

At first glance, it looks pretty much like any other speaker - clean lines, a bit of mood lighting while you listen, and the ability to wirelessly play music from your phone, and even Spotify. However, switch it on, and the difference between this and pretty much every comparable speaker becomes obvious - as does  the terrifying price tag. Scroll down for video   Put simply, the sound is stunning. Technically, it boasts 450 watts of power from six 75 watt digital amplifiers to power the built-in speaker.  What this equates to is jaw droppping good sound. It's clear, with amazing stereo separation for a single speaker, while bass is also excellent in all but the biggest of rooms. Design wise, it's extremely simple, with one large dial to control the volume (and its no ordinary dial, weighted to feel great).\\xa0 There are also a couple of touchscreen buttons on the dial to switch sources, and a USB port to plug in a devices. Underneath there's an ethernet port - and if you can, its well worth using this to squeeze every bit of quality out of music. It'll also play pretty much any file you throw at it, can stream 24bit/192kHz high resolution ‘better than CD’ quality music, as well all audio formats from Apple Lossless CD imports from iTunes to HD formats such as WAV, FLAC and AIFF, all from Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, laptops and other storage devices. It also includes AirPlay, UPnP (Universal Plug ‘n’ Play), Bluetooth (aptX), internet radio and native support for Spotify Connect. The only thing that really lets the system down is a rather ugly app - however, it reality you'll rarely need to use it.\\xa0 It also took a few attempts to set the unit up initially, but it got there in the end.\\xa0 There's also a basic remote control, which means you really do rarely need the app.\\xa0 One problem you will encounter is actually a rather unusual one - the Naim is actually too good at times, making all but the best quality files sound a little lacking.\\xa0 However, streaming services such as Spotify, and the latest downloads do sound great - while the higher quality lossless files sound absolutely stunning.  Overall, the price tag is a little intimidating, but after spending a bit of time you'll see that you really do get what you pay for - and the Naim mu:so is the best all in one speaker I've ever heard.\\xa0 Additionally, it'll also give all but the very best separates systems a run for their money - and bodes well for the British firm's chances in the US.

'We were on a 15 minute walk to the restaurant. Within five minutes two guys on a moped came to my right hand side, threw acid and drove off straight away. Within seconds. 'One of the guys on the back gave a smile, but that was it, a bit sadistic, but that was it.'\\xa0 Katie described how her 'survival instinct' prompted her to run across the road to a cafe where she showered before she was taken to a hospital.\\xa0 Remarkably she had the wherewithal to check the quality of the equipment and, realising that the needles were not properly sterilised, opted against any intravenous treatment.\\xa0\\xa0 She said: 'The pain was obscene but in the first hospital it was so run down, all the needles were open, so I didn't want to have a needle.'\\xa0 After being briefly taken to a second hospital, Katie was eventually airlifted back to the UK, with the aircraft making four stops to refuel en route.\\xa0 She was admitted to\\xa0Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where she began the long road of treatment and recovery, helped by a dedicated team of medical staff.\\xa0 During the first three years after the attack, she had to wear a plastic face mask and full body compression suit for 23 hours a day.\\xa0 Speaking earlier this month, Katie said: 'In the first few years I barely went out,' Katie says.\\xa0 'I had no confidence.

Researchers from mobile connectivity firm iPass surveyed more than 1,700 people in the US and Europe about their connectivity habits, preferences and expectations. The survey revealed some of the most inappropriate situations in which people have felt the need to check their phone – during sex (seven per cent), on the toilet (72 per cent) and even during a funeral (11 per cent). Nearly two thirds of people said they felt anxious when not connected to the Wi-Fi, with many saying they'd give up a range of items and activities in exchange for a connection. Sixty-one per cent of respondents said that Wi-Fi was impossible to give up – more than for sex (58 per cent), junk food (42 per cent), smoking (41 per cent), alcohol (33 per cent), or drugs (31 per cent). A quarter of respondents even went so far as to say that they'd choose Wi-Fi over a bath or shower, and 19 per cent said they'd choose Wi-Fi over human contact. As a result, Apple, Google and Facebook have recently launched tools meant to educate users on their daily smartphone habits. Many inform users of how many hours they've spent on a specific app.\\xa0 Others have gone a step further and introduced features that help users curb their app or smartphone addiction.\\xa0 This year, Apple introduced a 'Screen Time' app for iOS users that can disable your device for a certain time period, while Google's 'Digital Wellbeing' suite of tools enforces strict time limits and disables certain apps to prevent users from opening them.\\xa0 Facebook-owned Instagram will now notify users when they're 'all caught up' to prevent absentminded scrolling.\\xa0\\xa0 Many teens are taking matters into their own hands: 52 percent said they have cut back on the time they spend on their phones and 57 percent did the same with social media. 'As they look at their own lives and those of their peers, most teens see things that worry them,' the study noted.\\xa0\\xa0 Almost nine-in-ten teens believe spending 'too much time online' is a problem facing their age group, while 60 percent identified it as a 'major' issue. Experts say parents have a big role in their kids' screen habits and setting a good example is a big part of it. 'Kids don't always do what we say but they do as we do,' said Donald Shifrin, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who was not involved in the Pew study.\\xa0 'Parents are the door that kids will walk through on their way to the world.'\" => 1\n",

      "\"Jo Konta has admitted her disappointment at withdrawing plans to build a dream home for her parents out of her tournament earnings. The British No 1, who begins her US Open campaign by playing sixth seed Caroline Garcia on Tuesday, pledged to buy a house when she made £940,000 by winning last year's Miami Open. She revealed that privacy concerns contributed to her pulling out of the project this summer, in addition to objections from the local parish council that received widespread publicity. Konta was in negotiations to build an eco-home in Sussex's Ashdown Forest but the scheme did not go down well locally. 'We have looked at different options, either buying a home, renovating or buying a piece of land and building a home,' Konta said at Flushing Meadows. 'We withdrew it because quite frankly I don't want to live in a place where everybody and the cat knows where it is. I believe the owners of the land — I don't own the land, it was all down to whether the planning application was going to come through — is still pursuing to sell the land and build on it.' Konta's ranking has fallen to 46 this year but she has a 3-2 record against the talented French No 1. 2017 - First round 2016 - Fourth round 2015 - Fourth round 2014 - First round 2013 - Qualifying 2012 - Second round\\xa0 She is buoyed by having thrashed Serena Williams recently in San Jose, although the American later revealed that she was distracted by news prior to the match that the man who shot dead her half- sister 15 years ago had been given parole. Konta was unaware at the time. She said: 'I was clear on the gameplan I wanted to execute and I was going to do that to the best of my ability so I purposely paid no attention to necessarily what she was going to be doing on the other side of the court.' Aside from Andy Murray, three other British players are in first-round action.

      "\"A British-built laser satellite has been launched into space on a three-year mission that could revolutionise how weather forecasts are made across the globe. The Aeolus spacecraft,\\xa0named after the keeper of the winds in Greek mythology, took off on a rocket from Kourou in French Guiana 24 hours later than planned due to bad weather above the spaceport. Floating nearly 200 miles (320km) above Earth's surface, the satellite will fire lasers into the planet's lower atmosphere to track wind speed and direction. It is hoped the high-altitude data it collects will improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and help protect people from disasters such as floods and hurricanes. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Aeolus launched atop a European Space Agency (ESA) Vega rocket at\\xa010:20pm BST (5:20pm ET) on Wednesday following almost a decade of delays to the project. Less than an hour later, the rocket delivered the 1,360-kilo (3,000lb) satellite into orbit. It forms part of the Copernicus project, a joint initiative of the European Union and ESA to track environmental damage and aid disaster relief operations. The satellite was built by Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage and – equipped with a powerful laser – will be the first able to directly measure wind speeds on Earth from space.\\xa0 James Cotton, a satellite winds scientist at the Met Office, said: 'The Aeolus mission aims to improve the global coverage of wind profile observations, including areas where in situ wind measurements are currently lacking, such as over the oceans, in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. 'Within numerical weather prediction, we expect the Aeolus winds to be particularly useful for improving our analysis of the atmospheric state in the tropics, a region where we know the model wind errors are large.' The Aeolus satellite, launched by the European Space Agency on August 22, 2018, will track wind speed and direction across the globe. During its three-year mission it will fire lasers into Earth's lower atmosphere and collect the scattering of light that reflects back from dust, gas and droplets of water moving in wind. The speed at which various markers, and the winds that carry them, are moving will be revealed by changes in the wavelength of the light.\\xa0 Scientists will use this data to predict the weather in the hopes of revolutionising weather forecasting methods. Aeolus will track wind speeds at altitudes between six and 18 miles (10-30 km) - a region that scientists currently struggle to measure. It will collect data from areas without ground-based weather stations, such as in remote regions on land or at sea. Aeolus is carrying just one large instrument, a Doppler wind lidar called Aladin. The tool will emit short, powerful light pulses from a laser through the atmosphere and collect light that is 'backscattered' from particles of gas, dust and droplets of water moving in the wind. Meteorologists will be able to use this information to help predict the weather at altitudes\\xa0between six and 18 miles (10-30 km). Scientists currently cannot measure wind speeds in this region using traditional ground-based weather systems. Speaking following the launch, Josef Aschbacher, ESA's director of earth observation programmes, said: 'Such pioneering technology has meant that it has been a demanding mission to develop, but thanks to all the teams involved we are thrilled that this extraordinary satellite is now in orbit.\\xa0 'We look forward to it living up to expectations.' Science minister Sam Gyimah said: 'The Aeolus mission is a great example of the potential real-world impacts that space can have on Earth. 'Its data will lead to more reliable weather forecasts that can be used by farmers, seafarers, construction workers and others to improve productivity and safety. 'Space is a key part of our modern industrial strategy and it is work like this that shows how vital our role in the European Space Agency is in bringing real benefits to UK companies.'\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "'Turbans are coming! Since Gucci sent turbanned models down the catwalk earlier this year, the trend has quickly been gathering momentum. According to Jane Taylor, hat-maker to the Duchess of Cambridge, turbans are set to be this autumn’s showstopper accessory. But if you’re not quite brave enough to pop to the shops in a turban, you can try the look in your own home — as part of your beauty regime. From deep conditioning your hair, to speed drying, try these six for size . . . BEST FOR QUICK HAIR DRYING Aquis Luxe hair turban, £24 at lookfantastic.com Being wet is, I am told, downright dangerous for my hair. When it is soaked, hair is more vulnerable to stretching and breaking, so the Aquis Luxe hair turban aims to remove water as fast as possible. It claims to reduce drying time by 50 per cent, reducing frizz. Does it work? Yes, brilliantly. The Aquis is made from two long, curved triangles of high-tech moisture-wicking fabric. After showering, I tip my head forward and drape the blunt end of it over the nape of my neck, and twist its long ends around my hair, as you would with a towel. There’s a lot of turban to twist — the long edge measures 1m, so my shoulder-length hair barely gives it enough to work with. A loop at the pointed end fastens to a button at the nape of the neck and holds it securely in place. When I come to dry my hair ten minutes later, it’s already halfway there. It’s hard to say if my hair is less frizzy as a result, but it dries in record time. How chic? Reasonably. Latest colours include a zingy tangerine number (above right). Worth-it factor? Absolutely! — but you wouldn’t want to wear it outside the house. 5/5 BEST FOR DEEP- CONDITIONING Heat-Treat Cap, £24.95 heattreatcap.com This is something really unusual. It has a lining of microwavable gel — the idea being that you wash your hair, apply your conditioner or masque, then heat the cap in the microwave and pile your locks inside it. The warmth from the hat will encourage hair cuticles to open, allowing oils and other treatment ingredients to penetrate more deeply. Does it work? It’s all a bit of a palaver. However, I used one of the three sachets of conditioning treatment that came with it and have to admit it leaves my hair noticeably softer and more lustrous than usual. It is a great treat for this time of year, particularly if you have been on holiday and your hair is a tad frazzled from the hot weather and dunking in the pool. How chic? Not chic. I look ridiculous with this on my head. Worth-it factor? It’s great — as long as you can actually muster time and energy to carry out regular treatments. 3/5 BEST FOR PRESERVING A BLOW-DRY The Silke Hair Wrap, £45 at silkelondon.com This silky little pre-formed turban  is a classy — and pricey — version of the silk hair wraps you can find cheaply on the internet — but it is a beauty, lovingly presented in a box.Why splash out on one? You’ll have heard how silk pillows help keep hair smooth by not scuffing up hair cuticles in the way cotton pillowcases do. This goes one better: if you tuck blow-dried hair into it overnight, it will emerge just as smooth and styled the next day. It also claims to extend time between washes by helping to distribute the natural oils produced by your head more evenly throughout each hair shaft. Does it work? Very well. Before bedtime, I twirl the curls of my professionally blow-dried hair into a sort of twisted ponytail and ease the Silke cap over the top. It feels secure and is still in place in the morning. When I pull it out, my hair looks very nearly as good as it did the day before. How chic? I definitely wouldn’t mind wearing this in company — preferably with a full length swishy silk dressing gown for a glamorous Thirties film-star look. Worth-it factor? I’ve had one of these for several years and use it regularly to make my blow-dry last longer. 5/5 BEST FOR AN ECO FRIENDLY OPTION Boots Botanics Bamboo Hair Turban, £7.50 boots.com Another hair-drying turban, this time made with environmentally-friendly bamboo fibres which help to dry hair faster and also, I’m told, to fight against odours so that it stays smelling fresher for longer. I’m puzzled when I see on the packaging that the fibre composition is 60 per cent viscose and 40 per cent cotton, until I learn 60 per cent of the viscose is made of bamboo. Does it work? Perfectly well. It’s a thin fabric but easily holds in all my hair and leaves it drip-free after ten minutes, though not as dry as with the Aquis. How chic? More functional than chic, though it’s a nice enough plain cream colour. Worth-it factor? This is not a luxury product, but it does a reasonable job. 3/5 BEST FOR A REAL BARGAIN BUY Marks & Spencer Hair Turban, £6, marksandspencer.com A reasonably sized hair-drying turban in a friendly mint green colour, which is plenty large enough to scoop up my sopping hair. Does it work? Adequately, but it doesn’t absorb water as quickly as the Aquis version, nor the Boots bamboo number. How chic? Not bad, but it is not something I would wear as a style statement. Worth-it factor? A bargain and looks the part, but not nearly as good as the Aquis. 2/5 BEST FOR CHIC SHOWERING Shhhowercap, £35 at feelunique.com In the package, this looks like a fabric turban, which made me wonder how it would hold up under the shower. It turns out that it is made from nano-tech fabric which is hydrophobic, so it actually repels water. Does it work? Very well. There’s a plastic grippy strip at the front, to help hold it in place. It is much more secure than, say, a hotel shower-cap and less likely to rip. Water just rolls off it. How chic? Super chic, especially in the leopard-print version, but slightly odd shaped. Once it is full of hair, it looks a bit like a leopard print chef’s hat. Worth-it factor? I usually tie my hair up and dodge the shower jet to avoid getting it wet, which isn’t always successful — but this might persuade me to don a reliable hat. 4/5\\xa0' => 1\n",

      "'Fernando Alonso\\'s skid marks were implanted on a prong of titanium close to the head of 20-year-old Charles Leclerc - and the race went on. The \\'halo\\' — a metal frame protecting the cockpit and weighing 1st 1lb yet able to hold the weight of a double-decker bus — made the first save of its Formula One involvement as the Belgian Grand Prix, won by Sebastian Vettel, started with a bang.

There is a chance that without the halo, Leclerc, a Monegasque competing in his 13th race in his rookie season, would have been seriously injured, or worse. He knows all about the dangers, for he is the godson of the last man to have been killed in Formula One, Jules Bianchi. That death, following a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka four years ago, prompted the governing body, the FIA, to devise new and clever ways to save lives. Hence the halo.\\xa0 Leclerc walked away and, having changed into jeans, lolled by the Sauber pit wall as he watched the race unfold without him. First, he had to complete his drugs test, of all things. By now his mother, Pascale, was bombarding his telephone with frantic messages to ascertain his state of health. While he was busy with a urine bottle, his physio sent her the photos that proved he was fine. A few hours later, Leclerc was back in the Sauber motorhome as the Spa paddock was being packed up, and reflecting on his good fortune. \\'I have been lucky,\\' he said. \\'It went all very quickly and in the moment you don\\'t realise what is happening. I knew it was an orange car and I guessed it was Fernando passing over me. I felt the impact and looking at the image it is quite spectacular. \\'I got quite a lot of messages. My mum called me a lot of times. Everyone was quite worried. But my mum was calm when I had her on the phone. \"Are you OK?\" she asked, like any mother, I guess. These cars are so safe.\\' He reported that he was not even bruised and seemed surprised he was not being asked the usual post-race questions about tyre compounds. Leclerc, like Bianchi before him, is part of the Ferrari stable. Last year\\'s Formula Two champion, he was even tipped for a drive in the red team next season. That is not likely to happen, however, with Kimi Raikkonen expected to remain Sebastian Vettel\\'s No 2 for 2019. But at least Leclerc will have a chance of promotion in coming seasons, something that was taken away from Bianchi at the age of 25. Hulkenberg was called to the stewards to explain his error. The officials announced he would be sent 10 places down the grid at the next race in Monza on Sunday. \\'The driver of car 27 stated that he completely misjudged the situation and freely admitted it was his mistake,\\' said the FIA statement. Alonso was less understanding than the stewards, saying: \\'Nico missed the braking point and he played bowling with us. The drivers think it is the last corner of the championship and it has a high consequence. You think they would have a higher level to drive in this series. \\'I flew over Charles\\'s car and the halo was a very good thing to have today. We didn\\'t have any doubts about it, but this accident shows it offers good protection. The replay showed that beyond doubt.\\' Hulkenberg, who still had not spoken to Leclerc several hours later, said: \\'When I hit the brakes, it locked up the front wheels and I slid. These cars are aerodynamically sensitive, especially with cars bunching up ahead as you lose a lot of grip and load. \\'I have to admit it caught me by surprise today. It was probably a misjudgment from my side as I was a bit late on the brakes, so it\\'s frustrating for me, the team and the other drivers caught up in the incident. That\\'s racing and unfortunately these things happen.\\' More prosaically, the accident brought about a safety car phase by which time Lewis Hamilton had surrendered the lead his pole position briefly afforded him. The Briton appeared slightly unsteady coming out of the towering Eau Rouge corner and was passed on the Kemmel Straight by Vettel\\'s fundamentally faster Ferrari. Hamilton poked the nose of his Mercedes right on Vettel\\'s tail at the restart, but could not make the attempted pass stick. Vettel, in control thereafter, finished 11 seconds ahead of Hamilton in second place with Red Bull\\'s Max Verstappen third, a further 20 adrift. It was Vettel\\'s 52nd win of his career, taking him past Alain Prost and reduced his deficit to Hamilton in the drivers\\' standings to 17 points with eight rounds remaining - but the significance of the mathematics was put in its place by Leclerc\\'s miracle of scientific deliverance.\\xa0' => 1\n",

'This year, with the new surface, is the first time we've encountered quite so much standing water in critical places on the track. So yes it's a direct result of the track surface. 'The staff have done an unbelievable effort over the whole weekend to try and make the track safe and until the last minute they were still working, but unfortunately we couldn't battle nature.'

      "\"A prehistoric 13-year-old girl who lived 50,000 years ago was the love child of two separate species of ancient human ancestor, according to a new DNA analysis of her remains. A study of a tiny bone fragment found in a cave in Russia shows the teenager had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, giving fresh insight into how the now-extinct species interacted. The find suggests that our ape-like cousins mated far more frequently than researchers thought, according to archaeologists. Neanderthals and Denisovans share a common ancestor with humans, and roamed Eurasia as far back as 400,000 years ago having migrated from Africa. The pair of human-like species then intermingled with modern humans when they arrived on the continent around 40,000 years ago, with members of the three species sometimes cross-breeding. This means that tiny amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA can still be found in our genome today, with a study last year discovering that as much as 2 per cent of our DNA was passed to us from Neanderthals. Research in March also showed that at least two\\xa0modern human genomes - one from Oceania and another from East Asia - have distinct Denisovan ancestry. Scroll down for video  'We knew from previous studies that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have occasionally had children together,' said study coauthor Viviane Slon of the Max Planck Institute\\xa0for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. 'But I never thought we would be so lucky as to find an actual offspring of the two groups.' Archaeologists came to their finding after sequencing the DNA of bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia's Altai Mountains. The ancient individual is only represented by a single fragment so small that researchers call it a 'bone needle'. 'The fragment is part of a long bone, and we can estimate that this individual was at least 13 years old,' said Dr Bence Viola, an archaeologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study. After sequencing the genome of the young girl, scientists found she was the child of a Neanderthal mother and Denisovan father - putting her among the first specimens to show direct evidence the species mixed. 'An interesting aspect of this genome is that it allows us to learn things about two populations – the Neanderthals from the mother's side, and the Denisovans from the father's side,' said coauthor Dr Fabrizio Mafessoni.\\xa0 Thousands of ancient hominin bones were uncovered in the Denisova Cave in 2012, including the 120,000-year-old toe bone of a Neanderthal and the first ever evidence of a Denisovan - the\\xa0phalanx of a child who lived between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. It is commonly believed that a common ancestor of the two species migrated from Africa to Eurasia between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago and then split. The Denisovans are an extinct species of human that appear to have lived in Siberia and even down as far as southeast Asia. Although remains of these mysterious early humans have only been discovered at one site - the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, DNA analysis has shown they were widespread. DNA from these early humans has been found in the genomes of modern humans over a wide area of Asia, suggesting they once covered a vast range. They are thought to have been a sister species of the Neanderthals, who lived in western Asia and Europe at around the same time. The two species appear to have separated from a common ancestor around 200,000 years ago, while they split from the modern human Homo sapien lineage around 600,000 years ago.\\xa0 Bone and ivory beads found in the Denisova Cave were discovered in the same sediment layers as the Denisovan fossils, leading to suggestions they had sophisticated tools and jewellery. DNA analysis of a fragment of a fifth digit finger bone in 2010, which belonged to a young girl, revealed they were a species related to, but different from, Neanderthals. Later genetic studies suggested that the ancient human species split away from the Neanderthals sometime between 470,000 and 190,000 years ago.\\xa0 Anthropologists have since puzzled over whether the cave had been a temporary shelter for a group of these Denisovans or it had formed a more permanent settlement. DNA from molar teeth belonging to two other individuals, one adult male and one young female, showed they died in the cave at least 65,000 years earlier. Other tests have suggested the tooth of the young female could be as old as 170,000 years. A third molar is thought to have belonged to an adult male who died around 7,500 years before the girl whose pinky was discovered.  Scientists have long pondered how much the ape-like ancestors interacted with one another after they separated - though genetics research has previously suggested individuals occasionally crossbred. Neanderthals and Denisovans went extinct around 40,000 years ago, likely due to competition for resources and shelter brought by a wave of modern humans arriving from Africa. The new analysis showed the girl's mother was genetically closer to Neanderthals who lived in western Europe than to the Neanderthal individual that lived earlier in Denisova Cave. The Neanderthals were a close human ancestor that mysteriously died out around 50,000 years ago. The species lived in Africa with early humans for hundreds of millennia before moving across to Europe around 500,000 years ago. They were later joined by humans taking the same journey some time in the past 100,000 years.\\xa0 These were the original 'cavemen', historically thought to be dim-witted and brutish compared to modern humans. In recent years though, and especially over the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent we've been selling Neanderthals short. A growing body of evidence points to a more sophisticated and multi-talented kind of 'caveman' than anyone thought possible. It now seems likely that Neanderthals buried their dead with the concept of an afterlife in mind. Additionally, their diets and behaviour were surprisingly flexible. They used body art such as pigments and beads, and they were the very first artists, with Neanderthal cave art (and symbolism) in Spain apparently predating the earliest modern human art by some 20,000 years. This shows that Neanderthals migrated between western and eastern Eurasia tens of thousands of years before their disappearance. Analyses of the genome also revealed that the Denisovan father had at least one Neanderthal ancestor further back in his family tree. 'So from this single genome, we are able to detect multiple instances of interactions between Neanderthals and Denisovans,' said study coauthor Benjamin Vernot. Professor Svante Pääbo, lead author of the study, added: 'It is striking that we find this Neanderthal/Denisovan child among the handful of ancient individuals whose genomes have been sequenced. 'Neanderthals and Denisovans may not have had many opportunities to meet. But when they did, they must have mated frequently – much more so than we previously thought.'\\xa0 The two human-like ancestors are known to have mated with modern humans when they first migrated to Eurasia around 40,000 years ago, meaning Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA exists in our genome today. Research in March showed\\xa0our forefathers successfully interbred with Denisovans on at least two occasions. Today, around 5 per cent of the DNA of some Australasians – particularly people from Papua New Guinea – is Denisovans. Now, researchers have found two distinct modern human genomes - one from Oceania and another from East Asia - both have distinct Denisovan ancestry. The genomes are also completely different, suggesting there were at least two separate waves of prehistoric intermingling between 200,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was revealed last year some modern humans have more Neanderthal DNA in their genetic make-up than first thought, a new study has found. Research shows that between 1.8 and 2.6 per cent of the genomes of modern, non-African human populations is made up of Neanderthal DNA. This is far higher than previous estimates of 1.5 to 2.1 per cent. These genes play roles in our cholesterol levels, eating disorders, arthritis and other diseases today, the researchers claim. The study follows separate research, published yesterday, which found that Neanderthal DNA can drive our smoking habits, mood swings, and skin tone. The traditional view The traditional 'Out of Africa' model suggests that modern humans evolved in Africa and then left in a single wave around 60,000 years ago.\\xa0 The model often holds once modern humans left the continent, a brief period of interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred. This explains why individuals of European and Asian heritage today still have ancient human DNA. There are many theories as to what drove the downfall of the Neanderthals. Experts have suggested that early humans may have carried tropical diseases with them from Africa that wiped out their ape-like cousins. Others claim that plummeting temperatures due to climate change wiped out the Neanderthals. The predominant theory is that early humans killed off the Neanderthal through competition for food and habitat. How the story is changing in light of new research Recent findings suggest that the 'Out of Africa' theory does not tell the full story of our ancestors. Instead, multiple, smaller movements of humans out of Africa beginning 120,000 years ago were then followed by a major migration 60,000 years ago. Most of our DNA is made up of this latter group, but the earlier migrations, also known as 'dispersals', are still evident. This explains recent studies of early human remains which have been found in the far reaches of Asia dating back further than 60,000 years. For example, H. sapiens remains have been found at multiple sites in southern and central China that have been dated to between 70,000 and 120,000 years ago. Other recent finds show that modern humans reached Southeast Asia and Australia prior to 60,000 years ago. Based on these studies, humans could not have come in a single wave from Africa around this time, studies have found.\\xa0 Instead, the origin of man suggests that modern humans developed in multiple regions around the world. The theory claims that groups of a pre-human ancestors made their way out of Africa and spread across parts of Europe and the Middle East. From here the species developed into modern humans in several places at once.\\xa0 The argument is by a new analysis of a 260,000-year-old skull found in Dali County in China's Shaanxi Province. The skull suggests that early humans migrated to Asia, where they evolved modern human traits and then moved back to Africa.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"There was wide-scale migration in the ancient Viking settlement of Sigtuna, analysis of bone fragments has revealed. Half of the population were migrants to Sweden, according to analysis of the remains of 38 people who lived and died in the town during the 10th, 11th and 12th century. The study is the largest of its kind so far in Sweden and used a combination of several methods, including DNA analysis and strontium isotope analysis of teeth. Scroll down for video Sigtuna was formally founded around 980AD when Sweden’s first Christian king, Olof Skötkonung, resided in the city. More unknown is the fact that the picturesque town, which today is home to around 10000 people, was a distinctly cosmopolitan place back then. Researchers led by Stockholm University have analyzed the remains of 38 individuals from six different burial sites in Sigtuna. The analysis is based on a combination of methods including strontium analysis of the teeth which meant researchers could find out where\\xa0the individual lived in their youth. Researchers found that around half the population of Viking age Sigtuna originated from outside Mälardalen, according to the study published in Current Biology. 'We´re used to thinking of the Vikings as a travelling kind, and can easily picture the school books with maps and arrows pointing out from Scandinavia, as far as Turkey and America, but not so much in the other direction', said Maja Krzewinska, a researcher at the Archaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University and primary author behind the study. Roughly half of the individuals examined grew up in or around the Sigtuna area. The other half is equally divided in to regional immigrants (from southern Scandinavia, Norway and Denmark) and long-distance immigrants from further away. They were found to have come from the British Isles, Ukraine, Lithuania, northern Germany and other parts of central Europe. The Vikings made many many voyages of discovery during their history, including stops across Europe and North America.\\xa0 789AD Vikings begin their attacks on England 840AD Viking settlers found the city of Dublin in Ireland 844AD Vikings raid Seville but are repulsed 860AD Rus Vikings attack Constantinople 866AD York is captured by a Viking army 870AD Vikings colonise Iceland 981AD Erik the Red discovers Greenland 986AD Bjarni Herjolfsson sights North America after being blown off course 1002AD Leif Ericsson, son of Erik the Red, explores the coast of North America, named them Karland, Helluland and Vinland 1492AD Italian explorer Christopher Columbus lands in the New World when he stumbles across the islands now known as The Bahamas\\xa0 The immigration to Sigtuna was common for both males and females.\\xa0 Approximately 70 per cent of the female population was immigrants, compared to 44 per cent of the men. 'The archaeological record from Sigtuna never ceases to fascinate as it shows such a wide variety of cultural expressions',\\xa0said Anna Kjellström, osteologist at Stockholm University and one of the authors of the study. 'And here we see who grew up there and who moved to Sigtuna', she said. 'I especially like that we find 2nd generation immigrants among the buried, that kind of migratory information has never been encountered before as far as I know', said Anders Götherström, one of the leaders of the ATLASproject in which this study was conducted. Similar studies even further back in history would be very difficult since before the arrival of Christianity the deceased were normally cremated.\\xa0 This means there is insufficient material for DNA analysis. It is currently not known if the migrants wanted to be on the island and MailOnline has contacted the researchers for more information.\\xa0\\xa0 Some experts believe \\xa0the Vikings may have discovered North America nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus made his famous journey to the New World.\\xa0 L'Anse aux Meadows was the first Viking settlement believed to have been found in North America in the 1960s. In 2016, scientists claimed to have uncovered another Viking settlement in Newfoundland that was built between 800AD and 1300AD. The site, discovered in an area called Point Rosee in southern Newfoundland, is 400 miles (643km) south west of a Viking settlement found in L'Anse aux Meadows during the 1960s. Now, one expert claims to have found a mysterious location known as 'Hop'. Based on Viking descriptions, three key things identify this mystical settlement - an abundance of grapes, salmon and canoes made from animal hide.\\xa0 An archaeologist claims the only place that matches this description is the Miramichi-Chaleur bay area in northeastern New Brunswick in Canada. This would be the third Viking settlement claimed to have been found in North America, although it could be hard to ever prove it for once and for all. It is thought the Vikings first discovered America by accident in the autumn of 986AD, according to one historical source, the Saga of the Greenlanders. It tells how Bjarni Herjolfsson was stumbled across North America after being blown off course as he attempted to sail from Norway to Greenland, but he did not go ashore. Inspired by his tales, however, another Viking Leif Ericsson then mounted his own expedition and found North America in 1002. Finding it a fertile land, rich in grapes and berries, he named it Vinland. Eriksson also named two further 'lands' on the North American coast - one with flat stones, which he called Helluland, and one that was flat and wooded, named Markland. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

The baby girl - who has been named\\xa0Zani Batsinilas - comes after her 28-year-old mother and her partner, Georgio, have battled Thessy's endometriosis to get pregnant. Within minutes of her posting, Thessy was flooded with messages of support and congratulations.\\xa0 The Sydney-based fashion designer recently opened up about her struggle to get pregnant - which she did via two rounds of IVF - on account of her crippling endometriosis, which sent her into the menopause at just age 27. 'I once looked at myself and thought your body is broken,' Thessy wrote in a candid Instagram post\\xa0last month. 'You don't function like you're supposed to.

      "\"Foxes could become the must have pets of the future, after\\xa0scientists successfully isolated a slice of their genetic code linked to tameness and aggression - dubbed SorCS1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The study focused on the red fox, which have been reared by humans for over a century, and found 103 genomic regions involved in fox behaviour. Experts say that understanding the link between genetics and behaviour could help shed light on social behaviour in other animals - including people. These genetic markers are also associated with human behavioural conditions such as\\xa0autism and bipolar disorder. Scroll down for video\\xa0\\xa0 Red foxes have been bred in some parts of the world but - unlike their dog cousins - captive foxes generally exhibit fear or aggression toward humans. A 60-year study conducted by the Russian Institute of Cytology and Genetics has experimented with domesticating foxes and established a tame and an aggressive breed. One of the animal groups is eager for human interaction, while the other population has a tendency to behave violently toward humans. A third population of foxes acted as a control and was not selected for any particular behaviour.\\xa0\\xa0 'We've been waiting for this tool for a very, very long time,' says Anna Kukekova, assistant professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois and lead author of the paper.\\xa0\\xa0 'In our previous work, we tried to identify regions of the fox genome responsible for tame and aggressive behavior, but these studies required a reference genome and all we could use was the dog genome.\\xa0 'For us, the fox genome provides a much better resource for genetic analysis of behaviour.' The researchers sequenced the genomes of 10 individuals from each population, then compared them to the full fox genome and each other. They identify 103 genomic regions that were changed by the selective breeding programme.\\xa0\\xa0 Pets have been a companion to humans for millennia. In fact, according to\\xa0Greger Larson, director of the University of Oxford's palaeogenomics and bio-archaeology research network, humans have likely kept baby animals for amusement as long as humans have lived. But the story of exactly how animals\\xa0became domesticated is much debated and often only glimpsed at from scraps of fossils and DNA. Scientists largely agree that dogs were the first domestic animal. They were tamed and used for work or for their meat. A study published by University of Maine researchers in 2011 found evidence that dogs were being bred, and, eaten, by humans living in Texas some 9,400 years ago.  A more recent study in 2017 found\\xa0dogs were domesticated in a single event by humans living in Eurasia.\\xa0 Dr Krishna Veeramah, an assistant professor in evolution at Stony Brook University, told MailOnline: 'We've found clear evidence that dogs were domesticated 20,000 to 40,000 years ago. 'New research last year provocatively suggested that dogs could have been domesticated twice but our conclusion was there is no evidence for dual domestication. 'We would argue that finding evidence for only one domestication event is a big deal, because it is very important to helping us understand how domestication works.' His research found that dogs evolved to be a separate species from wild wolves sometime between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago.\\xa0 But it's not known if they were the first pets, and kept for companionship.\\xa0 A study this year found\\xa0 compared the genomes, or complete genetic codes, of modern domestic and wild rabbits to see how long it had taken them to diverge. Using the known mutation rate of certain biomolecules as a 'molecular clock' they found it was not possible to pin down rabbit domestication to a single date or event. Instead, the creation of tame buns appeared to be a cumulative effect stretching back to Roman times and possibly the Stone Age.\\xa0\\xa0 The story of domestication is not a linear progression from wild to domestic, Larsen told the Smithsonian.\\xa0 'These things exist on a continuum,' says Larson. He said when the first pet came into being is 'a bit like asking when did life begin?'  Some of these genetic marker turned out to be responsible for the tame and aggressive behaviours exhibited in the different fox groups. 'Finding genomic regions at such resolution was beyond any expectations with our previous tools.\\xa0 'Now, for the first time, we could not only pinpoint part of a chromosome which makes foxes more tame or aggressive, but we could identify specific genes responsible for it,' Dr Kukekova says.\\xa0 Some of the geneomic regions are also known to be associated with human conditions and behaviours. One of the 103 is associated with\\xa0Williams-Beuren syndrome, a genetic disorder characterised by extremely outgoing, friendly behaviour. 'Oddly enough, we found the Williams-Beuren region in aggressive foxes, not tame ones. We thought it would be the opposite,' Dr Kukekova says.\\xa0 The mysterious finding exemplifies that far more research is needed to understand these genetic regions and how they work in different animals.\\xa0\\xa0 SorCS1 is involved in the formation and operation of synapses - the small gap between two neurones in the brain - and was clearly associated with a very specific behaviour in foxes.\\xa0 Human handlers interact with the foxes in a very controlled way as part of their videotaped fox behavioural assessments. Handlers stand near the enclosures for one minute, hold the door open for another minute, reach toward the fox for a third minute, then close the door, and stand near the enclosure for one final minute.\\xa0\\xa0 One group of foxes clamoured for more human interaction after being left alone and this population had a version of the SorCS1 gene not found in the aggressive population.\\xa0 'We think this gene makes foxes more tame, but we don't want to overemphasize it - tameness isn't associated with a single gene.\\xa0 'The picture is definitely more complex,' Dr Kukekova says.\\xa0 The research was published in the journal\\xa0Nature Ecology and Evolution.\" => 1\n",

      "\" Xbox One Exclusive - $59.99 - Available November 15th 2015 Lara Croft is arguably one of the most iconic video game protagonists in history.\\xa0 Since her first appearance in the original\\xa0Tomb Raider\\xa0on the PlayStation in 1996, there have been two movies, 10+ games, multiple continuities and a plethora of actors who have taken up the Tomb Raiding mantle. In 2013 Crystal Dynamics rebooted the series and re-established Lara's origin story in the critically acclaimed\\xa0Tomb Raider, with British actress Camilla Luddington (of Grey's Anatomy/True Blood fame) taking on the role of the archaeologist and part time relic hunter. Scroll down for video\\xa0 After surviving the intense events on the island of Yamatai in the last game, Lara now finds herself actively seeking out danger in the pursuit of truth and discovery in her latest outing, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Crystal Dynamics did a fantastic job of grounding Lara in reality in Tomb Raider, so there are big expectations for Rise.  From what we've seen so far and from our hands on with the first tomb in\\xa0Rise of the Tomb Raider at the EB Expo in Sydney,  expect plenty of beautiful and hostile environments, 30-40 hours of content and more tombs to explore than you can shake an icepick at. Dailymail.com sat down with Lead Designer Mike Brinker to get the lowdown on Lara's latest adventure. Lara had some pretty intense and traumatic experiences on Yamatai island in the last outing and in the teaser trailer released last year we saw that she was working with a therapist, how important is Lara’s character development and growth as a person to her journey? Huge. Lara’s adventure and her story is super paramount and super important to not only this game but the franchise.\\xa0 If you look at what we’re trying to do with\\xa0Rise and what the big focus is, you have to look at the end of the last game and you see that she starts to get a hint for some of these truths and mysteries that are actually out there.\\xa0 That is really more of the through line for what\\xa0Rise of the Tomb Raider\\xa0is all about.\\xa0 She knows these things exist and she has to – and feels the need to – uncover these truths and risk life and limb to solve these mysteries…\\xa0 I think what makes an interesting character and what makes something so special about\\xa0Rise is that Lara is now driven and she knows those risks and she’s prepared – she’s not just a survivor like last time. One of the great things about Crystal Dynamics is that you guys haven’t shied away from showing how Lara’s past experiences have sculpted her both physically and emotionally, has it always been important to present Lara as not just a two-dimensional ice pick wielding badass but also a person experiencing very real human emotion? Absolutely. There’s a sequence with Jonah that is really important because it talks about things that are universal to all of us.\\xa0 Those are truths and sacrifices we all have to make in our daily lives.\\xa0 The universal look and take on that is something that grabs everybody.\\xa0 That’s true for not only good characterisation and good story telling but also for our layers of history and narrative that are grounded in things we know people understand and that are real…\\xa0 For example, our game director Brian Horton went to Turkey and took photo reference, studied the architecture and went into some actual tombs and crypts and got reference material that was used to build some of the Syrian tomb.\\xa0 It’s that grounding in both our fiction, our characterisation and our world that makes\\xa0Tomb Raider really shine. The Lara we saw on Yamatai is obviously very different to the Lara we are seeing now. On Yamatai she was thrust into the wild and forced to survive, forced to fight and forced to kill. In Rise we see a hardened and focus Lara with very different motivations. Will the skills and abilities she’s picked up previously influence how she approaches problem-solving in Rise? Yes there is a mix of both.\\xa0 There are some core elements that we know we did right on the last game that we are bringing forward… like her bow and her axe.\\xa0 Those are very iconic imagery from our reboot that people know and love now, and what we are doing now is bringing some of those common elements back but then expanding upon them.\\xa0 So now it’s not just an axe, it’s dual axes. It’s not just one bow, it’s multiple bows that you can switch between throughout the game and upgrade based on how you want to play.\\xa0 We take a little bit of what people know, we thrust it into this game but then we expand, broaden and then deepen. Were you surprised the ice pick became so iconic? No but I’m glad that it did! People tend to latch on and pick things out that they really like.\\xa0 One of my favourite articles that someone wrote was about our bow and that we were ‘Bow of the Year’ back when it first came out and there were games with bows all over the place. \\xa0They were like ‘Tomb Raider’s bow was so awesome!’ and I was like ‘YES!’. That’s one of my favourite things ever. How has Lara’s arsenal changed since Rise? She has some new traversal items and some new weapons but she also has a deepened RPG element which is not just having a new set of skills… but also having the crafting system that involves not just making new weapons and gear but also crafting portables.\\xa0 For example, she can be in a situation where she finds a tin can and she can use it as a distraction object, or if she has the right resources she can craft it into a smoke bomb.\\xa0 It’s about being smart and resourceful as a character because she’s going into these things knowing there’s going to be danger and using those elements to her advantage… Those are the things that play into what make this game sing. In the last game Lara was able to loot animals and collect salvage from crates and other sources. Will this be returning in Rise? Yes animals are a big part of our eco-system and they do yield different resources this time… Salvage makes a diversion in our game now, it’s not just one thing, it’s multiple that can be broken down into different resources that you can use to spend on different things.\\xa0 So you’ll still have one element like springs that you can use to craft other stuff, so we break salvage out into a little finer detail. Can you tell us about the currency system in Rise? If you look at what we’re doing with depth, the translation system’s important for her as an archaeologist…\\xa0 But it’s not just about that. Once she learns those languages she can then translate monoliths which are these giant markers which are really kind of neat… They unlock these coin caches.\\xa0 Those coin caches then go feed into this economy of ‘hey I’m going to go and purchase this piece of gear that I couldn’t get earlier’. Those are the kinds of things I think that make not only our game broader but deeper, and that people will really start to appreciate. When you go and raid tombs, the rewards you earn for that are super special and really play into the rest of the game so it’s not just a ‘oh I found it and it’s done’. One of the main criticisms of the last game was the lack of puzzles. How important was it to bring this quintessential Tomb Raider element back into the franchise? I love that word that you just used – quintessential – because that’s exactly what I think of it as and what I was very responsible for this time around… You have to look at the 20 year history, you have to look at what that first iconic imagery was and how people felt when they came into this epic, giant, ancient space.\\xa0 That sort of discovery and that feeling of discovery is super important to the franchise. When people say ‘there weren’t that many puzzles in the last game’, really it was more about that feeling. So not only are we doubling down and making more, we are also making those tombs sing so you have that sense of discovery, you have those ancient, epic spaces that are awe-inspiring. But then they have other elements too that are really important, there’s a layer of history and narrative that plays not only for each of those tombs but also for circling back and delving into our main storyline…\\xa0 The other couple of things that are important about tombs this time around are that we have that deadly element which is not just traps but the deadly guardians…\\xa0 And then we have this new formula for how we are building our puzzles. In the last games it felt like there were less puzzles and it felt like there were not enough puzzles, but it’s really about those puzzles being singular chambers. Now we know that having a much bigger space means we’re going to pull those apart into multi-chambers and we call that our ‘nested formula’, so those play back into the centralised puzzle.\\xa0 Your brain does a little thing where you walk into a centralised space and you’re like ‘okay I get what the main problem is but how am I going to solve it?’ and as you walk into another spot things sort of switch and it becomes a difficult problem to solve ‘cause you’re having to layer these things together. Our nested formula is really helping to push not only just a little bit more of the difficulty but also that epic feel.\\xa0 I’m really excited that players are going to get a chance to not only be challenged by those things but also get that sense of ‘I’m back in the tombs!’ In games like Tomb Raider it can be challenging to balance puzzle difficulty. How have you approached balancing the difficulty of the puzzles this time around? We always look at difficulty on everything – not just puzzles – but puzzles themselves are tricky. Everyone has a different aptitude and a different level of skill when it comes to mentally putting pieces together. There’s a couple of things that we try and do when we’re working on that. Obviously a lot of user testing, constantly, even at the stages where we’re just paper designing. We get a lot of people to play it and we get an average of users who are getting through it and those who don’t...\\xa0 Our survival instinct system is back and it’s better than ever. We’ve got the ability for players to make that opt-in choice of using survival instincts but then it starts to layer in these hints of not just glowing things in the world but Lara’s VO… Which really helps those who are absolutely stuck and frustrated.\\xa0 We really don’t want people going to the internet y’know, there’s a system in the game to help you if you can’t figure it out. It’s there, but you don’t have to use it, in fact we even have an option in the main menu to turn off survival instinct – and I don’t recommend that – but it is there for those who really want a challenge. One of the most important elements in an action-adventure game is the balance between narrative and action. Considering the story driven nature of the reboot, how important has this balance been for Rise? Options are important and choice is important – that’s one of the main things we always focus on. Do we want to craft a wonderful linear story that people can experience? Sure, because people want to do that - but you don’t have to.\\xa0 There’s a lot of options to deviate from that main path. Our hub spaces are three times bigger than the last game so that means we have to fill it with a lot of more content, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that people are going to have to do it.\\xa0 They can make those loops through like that\\xa0Metroidvania style that people really like and they will experience the same space several different times that will feel different each time ‘cause you have new gear. Can you tell us about what it’s been like working with next generation hardware for Rise? Working on the Xbox One platform has been fantastic for us and the reason why is that it lets us focus in on some of the things we couldn’t do. Look at some of the tech… I was at Pax this year and people who weren’t even playing were walking by and their eyes were popping out of their heads because it looked so amazing, and that’s really due to our lighting engine. We have a new global lighting solution which is physical based rendering, so what that allows us to do is have a single light source that casts off shadows which ensures nice reflectance for all of our layering of textures.\\xa0 And then all of the skin – the sub surface scattering on Lara’s skin – and some of the animation stuff that we do with the characters.\\xa0 We have a lot more blend shapes and morph targets in their faces, so if you look closely at some of those cutscenes you’re going to get a lot more emotion out of Camilla and all the good motion capture data because we’ve been able to add a lot more to the characters.\\xa0 All of that really comes together and builds an experience that is the crème de la crème of\\xa0Tomb Raider\\xa0and that we’ve never really done before because this has been built from the ground up on Xbox.\\xa0 I’m super excited with what we’ve done with our tools, super excited for what the tech has given us and what allows us to present the quintessential tomb raiding experience to our fans. Will Rise be running in 1080p/60fps? We’ve targeted 1080p at 30fps and that’s highly due to the fact that we are really pushing the visuals… and once you start to get immersed in that the whole frames-per-second argument is going to go out of the window. Do you feel any pressure developing an iconic and powerful female protagonist such as Lara when she has become such a feminist icon? I look at the story and I look at the character and I look at what appeals to everyone.\\xa0 Universal truths are what to speak to all of us and I think that if you’re going to tell a good story and you’re going to tell a story about a character that is so iconic, you have to have universal truths… In order for people to get it and grasp that on a wide scale those universal truths are things about sacrifice, that we all want to know the truth and expose it and we want everyone to know what the core of the matter is. Those two things play into a lot of what everyone is going to get out of\\xa0Rise. Over the years Lara’s sex appeal has been the focus of many criticisms, was it important for Crystal Dynamics to move away from this and shift the focus on her being a hyper-intelligent, strong independent woman? If you look at what people are going to grasp and what’s long term for a lasting and iconic character it is much more multi-faceted.\\xa0 You’re never going to get a one-sided element out of it anymore and we would be fools to think otherwise.\\xa0 You have to have a multi-dimensional person at the helm of something so great because it’s not going to last otherwise.\\xa0 I can tell you that as a character and what we’ve done with the series I’m super excited about that because there’s so many more directions you can take it.\\xa0 There’s so many different things that Lara can experience that everyone can grasp and understand based on that diversity.\\xa0 That comes from not only having a team of diverse writers but a team of different people working with you…\\xa0 It’s really important to me that we had diversity at Crystal.\" => 1\n",

The ability to make video calls in WhatsApp was first launched in 2016. According to the company, WhatsApp users worldwide collectively spend around two billion minutes a day making voice and video calls.\\xa0 \\'We’re introducing this feature because we know that sometimes voice and text just aren’t enough,\\' the company said at the time. \\'There’s no substitute for watching your grandchild take her first steps, or seeing your daughter’s face while she’s studying abroad.\\'\\xa0 At the end of last year, the ability to make group voice and video calls feature was first spotted in the an early beta version of the messaging app by leakster group\\xa0WABetaInfo.\\xa0 The anonymous group revealed that WhatsApp was ‘internally working’ on a group voice-calling feature in the 2.17.70 beta release of the chat app.\\xa0 ‘There are a lot of hidden references about group voice calls, but there is only one reference about group video calls,’ WABetaInfo tweeted. The ability to add up to three people to video and voice calls comes less than a month after WhatsApp pushed-out its last update to users worldwide. WhatsApp has found a way to help users keep track of long group chats. The app now has a ‘group catch up’ tool that lets users quickly scroll to messages that mention them or reply to ones they\\'ve previously written. To do this, users should tap on the @ button that\\xa0appears at the bottom right corner of the chat. The Facebook-owned messaging service has also created a brief description outlining the aim of the chat.\\xa0 This can be found using the \\'Add group description\\' option in the \\'Group Info\\' section. This appears\\xa0when a new person joins. There is also a control that allows the group admin(s) to restrict who can change the group\\'s subject, icon and description which can be changed under \\'Group Settings\\'. Admins can also remove admin permissions of other participants and people who created groups can no longer be removed from them. Group creators can now no longer be removed from the groups they started, the company said.\\xa0 A participant search feature also means users can find any one else in the group by searching for participants on the group information page. This feature is available under the \\'Group Info\\' section. There is a \\'search\\' button next to the list of participants. In order to update WhatsApp on iPhone and get these features, users must go into the App Store and click on \\'updates\\' at the bottom.

      "\"Fears of the supervolcano lurking at the heart of Yellowstone National Park have long lingered in the backs of many Americans’ minds. It’s been nearly 650,000 years since the last giant eruption, and predicting when the next will occur is a complex feat that continues to elude scientists. Despite all the attention directed toward the supervolcano, experts monitoring activity at the park around the clock say it isn’t an eruption we should be immediately concerned about – it’s earthquakes. The seismically active region produces up to 2,500 small earthquakes a year on average, and scientists say it’s only a matter of time before it’s rocked by a much larger magnitude 7 event. Scroll down for video\\xa0 ‘The biggest concern we have for Yellowstone is not with the volcano, it’s with the earthquakes,’ Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told USA Today. ‘This is an underappreciated hazard in the Yellowstone area. There can and there will be in the future magnitude-7 earthquakes.’ The chances of a major volcanic eruption at Yellowstone are currently considered to be quite low; based on knowledge of three explosive eruptions in the past 2.1 million years, at an interval of about 600,000 to 800,000 years, scientists estimate the yearly probability of another major event to be about 1 in 730,000. Smaller lava flows have sprung up in the time between, with the last occurring about 70,000 years ago,USGS explains. Large earthquakes, on the other hand, are far more common. A magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the park just 59 years ago on August 17, 1959, spurring a landslide that resulted in 28 deaths. The event shook so many rocks loose – more than 80 million tons, experts estimate – that the debris blocked a river and created an entirely new lake, dubbed Earthquake Lake, according to USA Today. Another quake of this magnitude is likely to occur in the foreseeable future. And when it does, it will strike by surprise. ‘That’s something that happens on a human life scale,’ Poland told USA Today. ‘We can say where they are likely to occur, but we can’t say when.’ Compared to the quake that happened in the late 1950s, a magnitude 7 event at the park today would be far more catastrophic. Nasa believes drilling up to six miles (10km) down into the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park to pump in water at high pressure could cool it. Despite the fact that the mission would cost $3.46 billion (£2.63 billion), Nasa considers it 'the most viable solution.'\\xa0 Using the heat as a resource also poses an opportunity to pay for plan - it could be used to create a geothermal plant, which generates electric power at extremely competitive prices of around $0.10 (£0.08) per kWh. But this method of subduing a\\xa0supervolcano has the potential to backfire and trigger the supervolcanic eruption Nasa is trying to prevent. 'Drilling into the top of the magma chamber 'would be very risky;' however, carefully drilling from the lower sides could work.\\xa0 Even besides the potential devastating risks, the plan to cool Yellowstone with drilling is not simple. Doing so would be an excruciatingly slow process that one happen at the rate of one metre a year, meaning it would take tens of thousands of years to cool it completely.\\xa0 And still, there wouldn't be a guarantee it would be successful for at least hundreds or possibly thousands of years.\\xa0 Millions of people now visit the park each year, with human presence booming during the summer months. Scientists are continually monitoring Yellowstone for any signs that a hazard may be brewing, with live maps from multiple observatories showing where and how big each tremor is as it hits, paying particular attention to earthquake swarms. For now, the region remains at its normal alert level for both volcanic activity and seismicity, with earthquake activity said to be at background levels as of the most recent USGS update.\" => 1\n",

      "\"Brits no longer consider wedding traditions important to follow, new research has revealed.\\xa0 In fact, familiar customs are becoming a thing of the past with modern couples shunning his-and-hers rings, shared surnames and even bridesmaids in favour of trouser suits and 'best women'. In a nationwide study conducted by jewellers F. Hinds, just 31 per cent of Brits said they thought that traditions were important when it comes to the big day in a clear indication of changing attitudes. Gone are the days when speeches were the preserve of the men, with some 15 per cent of brides saying they had given a speech at their wedding. They found that just 30 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds consider it important to have a best man or bridesmaids, compared to 65 per cent of those over 65. The least important custom, according to respondents, was wedding favours - a small gift such as sugared almonds traditionally given to guests as a thank you, which is becoming increasingly irrelevant among modern couples. While it once would have been unimaginable not to ask the bride's father for permission, research shows 58 per cent of men no longer think it important. The study also unveiled a dramatic revamp of wedding traditions, with more and more people introducing their own. It appears more and more women are speaking up during their wedding reception, with 15 per cent of brides giving speeches, and a further 10 per cent of grooms choosing a 'best woman'. And in a marked change from bygone years, just 36 per cent of brides took the groom's surname, while 37 per cent of couples thought wedding rings were important. Further research revealed that of the 60 per cent of people who got married in a church, more than a third (32 per cent) do not consider themselves religious. When it comes to traditional wedding attire, 24 per cent of brides have chosen not to wear a classic ivory dress - with 6 per cent opting for a suit instead. The custom of the father walking the bride down the aisle is deemed the most important tradition overall, however it seems to be disappearing for the younger generation with just 50 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds deeming it important.\\xa0 The tradition of having the bride's father walking her down the aisle seems to be disappearing for younger generations; over 75 per cent of over 65s consider it to be important, compared to just half of 25-34 year-olds.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 . Taking husband's surname (36%)\\xa0 . Not seeing bride's dress (42%)\\xa0 . Having a best man (46%)\\xa0 . Asking father for permission (58%) . Church wedding (60%) . Traditional ivory dress (76%)\\xa0 . All-male speeches (85%)\\xa0 Jeremy Hinds, sales development director at F.Hinds, commented on the findings: 'Whilst traditions hold vital importance for many weddings, it is interesting to see the decline (and reinvention) of certain practices.\\xa0 'Many still choose to hold on to classic traditions but the modern age of 2018 will naturally mean times have moved forward. 'It was also interesting to see the generational split with more emphasis on traditions for the older generation and the younger generation moving away and recreating their own.

      "\"Traditional views of how early societies were formed have been called into question by the discovery of a\\xa0cemetery dating back 5,000 years. Experts say\\xa0it was built by an egalitarian group of 'mobile pastoralists' - without a social hierarchy. It was previously believed that a stratified social structure was necessary to enable the construction of large public buildings or monuments. At least 580 people - men, women and children - were buried at the site in Eastern Africa millennia ago, according to archaeologists. The cemetery - near Lake Turkana, in modern day Kenya - is the earliest and largest monumental cemetery The construction of such a big project contradicts long-standing beliefs about early complex societies.\\xa0 The international research team, which included experts from Stony Brook University in New York, say that the Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery. They believe it was constructed and used over a period of several centuries, between about 5,000 and 4,300 years ago. Early herders built a platform about 98 feet (30 metres) in diameter and excavated a large cavity in the centre to bury their dead.\\xa0 After the cavity was filled and capped with stones, the builders placed large, megalith pillars, some sourced from as much as a half a mile (one kilometre) away, on top. Stone circles and cairns were added nearby. The researchers say that an estimated minimum of 580 people were densely buried within the central platform cavity of the site. Men, women, and children of different ages, from infants to the elderly, were all buried in the same area, without any particular burials being singled out with special treatment. The researchers said that essentially all individuals were buried with personal ornaments and the distribution of ornaments was approximately equal throughout the cemetery. They said these factors indicate a relatively egalitarian society without strong social stratification. Historically, archaeologists have theorised that people built permanent monuments as reminders of shared history, ideals and culture, when they had established a settled, socially stratified agriculture society with abundant resources and strong leadership. It was believed that a political structure and the resources for specialisation were prerequisites to engaging in monument building. Ancient monuments have previously been regarded as reliable indicators of complex societies with differentiated social classes. But the Lothagam North cemetery was built by mobile pastoralists who show no evidence of a rigid social hierarchy. Doctor Elizabeth Sawchuk, of Stony Brook, said: 'This discovery challenges earlier ideas about monumentality. 'Lothagam North provides an example of monumentality that is not demonstrably linked to the emergence of hierarchy, forcing us to consider other narratives of social change.' She said the discovery is consistent with similar examples elsewhere in Africa and on other continents in which large, monumental structures have been built by groups thought to be egalitarian in their social organisation. The research team said the discover has the potential to reshape global perspectives on how - and why - large groups of people come together to form complex societies. They said it appears that Lothagam North was built during a period of profound change. Experts say\\xa0Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery. They believe it was constructed and used over a period of several centuries, between about 5,000 and 4,300 years ago. Early herders built a platform about 98 feet (30 metres) in diameter and excavated a large cavity in the centre to bury their dead. After the cavity was filled and capped with stones, the builders placed large, megalith pillars, some sourced from as much as a half a mile (one kilometre) away, on top.

Men, women, and children of different ages, from infants to the elderly, were all buried in the same area, without any particular burials being singled out with special treatment. Pastoralism had just been introduced to the Turkana Basin and newcomers arriving with sheep, goats, and cattle would have encountered diverse groups of fisher-hunter-gatherers already living around the lake. The research team said newcomers and locals faced a difficult environmental situation, as annual rainfall decreased during that period and Lake Turkana shrunk by as much as 50 per cent. They believe early herders may have constructed the cemetery as a place for people to come together to form and maintain social networks to cope with major economic and environmental change. Dr Anneke Janzen, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, said: 'The monuments may have served as a place for people to congregate, renew social ties, and reinforce community identity. 'Information exchange and interaction through shared ritual may have helped mobile herders navigate a rapidly changing physical landscape. 'After several centuries, pastoralism became entrenched and lake levels stabilised. It was around this time that the cemetery ceased to be used.' Study leader Associate Professor Elisabeth Hildebrand, of Stony Brook University, added: 'The Lothagam North Pillar Site is the earliest known monumental site in eastern Africa, built by the region's first herders. 'This finding makes us reconsider how we define social complexity, and the kinds of motives that lead groups of people to create public architecture.' The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\" => 1\n",

      "\"A size 18 mother-of-two who was unhappy with her\\xa0post-pregnancy body has told how she lost half her body weight\\xa0in just 12 months by giving up fry-ups and taking up hula-hooping. Danielle Cooper, from Berkshire, revealed that when she fell pregnant with her first child in 2011, she put on three stone and tipped the scales at 13st 9Ibs. The 30-year-old, who works at a supermarket head office, continued to pile on the pounds when she gave birth to her son in 2015, wearing a size 16-18. But when she came across a picture of herself at a friend's wedding in 2016, Danielle realised just how unhappy she felt with her appearance, and said it was the final straw, overhauling her diet and exercise regime. She now weighs 8st 12Ibs and is a UK size eight. She decided to join Slimming World and take up hula hooping, as well as swapping junk food and takeaways for healthy meals, and saw her weight shrink to 8st 12Ibs and a UK size eight. Danielle's weight is now below her target of 9st and she regularly shares pictures of her newly slim figure with 31,000 of her Instagram followers. Speaking about her journey, Danielle said: 'After the birth of my first child; nearly seven years ago I piled on roughly three stone. Then I fell pregnant again gaining more weight. 'I was not active in anyway what-so-ever; I got taxis everywhere I could barely walk up a few steps without losing my breath. 'When I had my two children especially my second I very quickly realised this, and it was heart breaking. 'I remember seeing a natural photo of me at a friend's wedding completely caught off-guard and that's when I realised how big I had got and that was the final straw. 'I joined Slimming World and I have since lost nearly five stone. I take my kids out for walks while they ride their bikes and I run alongside and even race them.\\xa0 'I've recently joined as a member at Nirvana Spa which is a huge deal for me because everyone walks around in their swimming costumes, which two years ago you'd never catch me doing. 'I started hula hooping about ten months ago, so I guess I was a good year into my journey. I wasn't confident to join a gym or go to classes. 'I always felt people would stare or laugh at me, plus it was really difficult to find time to leave the house with two small children. 'So, I bought a hula hoop one day and gave it a go and fell in love with it. I could stand in front of the TV or whack on my favourite music and hoop away. Now I even have my very own 30-day challenge that I share with others.' Since she shed the weight, Danielle feels more confident than she ever did, and her new physique has helped her raise her children. Danielle, who works at a supermarket head office, says the hardest part was avoiding the temptation to give up when she didn't quickly lose the weight. 'When I first started I lost two stone really quickly and after that my weight loss slowed down and I gave up,' she said. 'I started to hit the cupboards again along with ordering takeaways and soon enough I put a stone back on. 'I had to face going back to the group and seeing on paper I had gained that weight and that was the kick I needed. I've never looked back since. It made me think 'yes, we all have our bad days and that's OK'.'

      "\"On first viewing I thought Fabian Schar's challenge on Marcos Alonso was a penalty but, after watching a replay, the Newcastle defender does get a touch on the ball. Does this mean it is not a penalty? No, there is a difference between getting a touch and dispossessing a player. Schar uses a scissor motion to make the tackle and it is his second leg which is guilty of the foul, and it is a foul. So yes, I support the decision of Paul Tierney, although I understand why it will split opinion. This is one of those where even the use of VAR would not be definitive and would still lead to debate. As for Newcastle's goal, it should not have stood. DeAndre Yedlin clearly uses his arm in the face of Olivier Giroud and, for me, did so deliberately. This should have been spotted and a foul awarded before the cross is made for Joselu to score.\\xa0 If referee Anthony Taylor had use of VAR then I have no doubt he would have sent off Etienne Capoue. It is a jump, not a tackle, and he comes down on Wilfried Zaha’s Achilles with his studs - it is a red card because he has risked causing injury to his opponent. In real time, Taylor has probably seen this as a stepping action and I understand why he has issued a yellow card. But after seeing a replay I am sure he would have upgraded to a red. Capoue will, of course, escape retrospective action now because Taylor saw the challenge and has dealt with it.\\xa0 You can argue Willy Boly’s handball is not deliberate, but it never feels right that a player can use his arm or hand to score a goal, especially as he changed the direction of the ball and gained an advantage by doing so. It should have been a free-kick to Manchester City. It is difficult, however, to attach blame to referee Martin Atkinson. For starters, it looked like a perfectly good goal on first viewing. He also has several players blocking his view and must rely on his assistant to make the call. The assistant, in his defence, is also checking for offside and it looks like Matt Doherty does make slight contact with the ball. It is a tight decision as Benjamin Mendy’s foot could still be playing Boly onside, so the benefit must go to the attacking team. But the key here is that a handball goal was missed and it is yet another example of the need for technology to assist the officiating team, because I think it was near enough impossible for them to see this in real time.\" => 1\n",

      "\"NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has revealed his hopes for long-term human settlement on the moon. In a meeting with reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston this week, Bridenstein elaborated on plans to build ‘Gateway’ modules that will orbit the moon and, ultimately, close the gaps in space exploration. ‘We want lots of humans in space,’ Bridenstine said, according to Space.com. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The Gateway craft will initially support brief science missions of about 30-60 days, and will be key to exploring the moon in greater detail than ever before. And, in the years to follow, a second module could be used to carry astronauts to Mars. ‘The first Gateway is about the moon, but I think the second Gateway, being a deep-space transport, again using commercial and international partners, enables us to get to Mars,’ Bridenstine said. ‘What we don’t want to do is go to the surface of the moon, prove that we can do it again, and then be done. ‘We want to go to stay. And the Gateway, in my view – I’ve been convinced – enables us to take advantage of commercial and international partners in a more robust way so we are there to stay, it enables us to get to more parts of the moon than ever before, and it enables us to get to Mars.’ Earlier this week, Bridenstine outlined a vision for renewed and 'sustainable' human exploration of the moon, citing the existence of water on the lunar surface as a key to chances for success. 'We know that there's hundreds of billions of tons of water ice on the surface of the moon,' Bridenstine said in a Reuters TV interview in Washington on Tuesday, a day after NASA unveiled its analysis of data collected from lunar orbit by a spacecraft from India. The Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, previously known as the Deep Space Gateway, will orbit the moon. Nasa says it will open up opportunities for future exploration of deep space, as well as a return to the moon and missions to Mars. The first modules of the station will be completed as soon as 2025 with construction starting in 2022. Similar to the International Space Station, this new space station will be open to to astronauts and cosmonauts globally. It could provide a staging point for the proposed Deep Space Transport vessel, which is designed to send astronauts and cosmonauts around the solar system. China and India as well as other members of the BRICS Nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) may join. The mission will give more information about the moon and also allow easy access to Mars.\\xa0 The findings, published on Monday, mark the first time scientists have confirmed by direct observation the presence of water on the moon's surface - in hundreds of patches of ice deposited in the darkest and coldest reaches of its polar regions.\\xa0 The discovery holds tantalizing implications for efforts to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century.\\xa0 The presence of water offers a potentially valuable resource not only for drinking but for producing more rocket fuel and oxygen to breathe. Bridenstine, a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot and Oklahoma congressman tapped by President Donald Trump in April as NASA chief, spoke about 'hundreds of billions of tons' of water ice that he said were now known to be available on the lunar surface. But much remains to be learned. NASA lunar scientist Sarah Noble told Reuters separately by phone that it is still unknown how much ice is actually present on the moon and how easy it would be to extract in sufficient quantities to be of practical use. 'We have lots of models that give us different answers. We can't know how much water there is,' she said, adding that it will ultimately take surface exploration by robotic landers or rovers, in more than one place, to find out. Most of the newly confirmed frozen water is concentrated in the shadows of craters at both poles, where the temperature never rises higher than minus-250 degrees Fahrenheit. Although the moon was long believed to be entirely dry or nearly devoid of moisture, scientists have found increasing evidence in recent years that water exists there. A NASA rocket sent crashing into a permanently shadowed lunar crater near the moon's south pole in 2009 kicked up a plume of material from beneath the surface that included water. A study published the following year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that water is likely widespread within the moon's rocky interior, in concentrations ranging from 64 parts per billion to five parts per million. Experts from the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, used near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to find surface water at the moon's polar regions. NIRS makes use of the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, from about 700 to 2,500 manometers.\\xa0 By measuring light scattered off of and through a sample, NIRS can be used to quickly determine a material's properties without damaging it.\\xa0\\xa0 It can also distinguish between different types of water, including surface, ice, surface adsorbed,\\xa0liquid or bound in minerals. The data was acquired by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, India's first lunar probe.\\xa0\\xa0 Ice in the form of H20 was detected in areas of permanent shadow in the moon's polar regions and only in around 3.5 per cent of the moon's shadow covered area. Bridenstine spoke to Reuters about making the next generation of lunar exploration a 'sustainable enterprise,' using rockets and other space vehicles that could be used again and again. 'So we want tugs that go from Earth orbit to lunar orbit to be reusable.\\xa0 'We want a space station around the moon to be there for a very long period of time, and we want landers that go back and forth between the space station around the moon and the surface of the moon,' Bridenstine said. NASA's previous program of human moon exploration ended with the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Trump last December announced a goal of sending American astronauts back to the moon, with the ultimate goal of establishing 'a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars.' The Trump administration's $19.9 billion budget proposal for NASA for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 includes $10.5 billion for human space exploration. The budget supports development of NASA's new Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft designed to carry a crew into space.\\xa0 The administration envisioned a SLS/Orion test flight around the moon without a crew in 2020, followed by a fly-around mission with a crew in 2023. As part of the budget proposal, NASA also is planning to build the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway - a space station in moon orbit - in the 2020s.\\xa0 NASA said the power and propulsion unit, its initial component, is targeted to launch in 2022. In May, NASA canceled a lunar rover that was under development, a project envisioned as the first mission to conduct mining somewhere other than Earth.\" => 1\n",

      "\"Three skeletons have been found inside a black granite sarcophagus uncovered in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria in July. Nadia Kheider, from Egypt's Antiquities Ministry, revealed the skeletons belong to a woman in her early 20s, a man in his late 30s and a man in his early 40s. The female was relatively short, measuring between 5 foot 3 inches and 5 foot 5 inches (160 to 164 cm) tall and the youngest male was only marginally bigger. The eldest of the skeletons is also by far the largest, measuring an impressive 6 foot tall (181 cm).\\xa0 One of the males had a small hole in the back of his head that was\\xa0originally thought to be an arrow wound but the researchers now think it\\xa0as a result of 'surgical intervention' and the person lived for some time after the drastic procedure. This operation - known as trepenation - releases pressure and swelling and was thought to rid the person of any evil spirits lurking inside them. It is believed the bodies were buried on two different occasions, as every skeleton was found on top of one another.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mostafa Waziri, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the researchers also discovered small gold plates wrapped in elaborate artwork alongside the remains. The artwork is believed to indicate military rank, and could prove that the individuals were Egyptian soldiers. Red fluid and sewage water festered in the\\xa02,000-year-old sarcophagus and caused a social media sensation.\\xa0The ministry says the liquids likely accelerated the rate of decomposition and that it is now being studied in greater detail. More studies are now being performed on the bones, including DNA analysis and CT scans, to find out more about them and to determine whether they were members of a single family.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The hole in the head of one of the males indicates he underwent trepenation, which involved removing a chunk of the cranium via scraping or drilling.\\xa0 Trepenation was\\xa0common in many cultures throughout history, but was relatively rare in Ancient Egypt, according to Dr Zeinab Hashish, head of the research team studying the sarcophagus.\\xa0 She said: 'This surgery is the oldest surgical intervention ever known since pre-history, but was rare in Egypt.' They added that only a few skulls from ancient Egypt were found to have undergone the procedure. The mysterious ten foot (three-metre) sarcophagus was found on the northern coast of Egypt in the city of Alexandria which was founded by the legendary leader of the same name. The 6.5ft (two metre) high coffin was first discovered last month in a 30-ton (27,000 kg) tomb that was found buried 16ft (five metres) beneath the ground of the city. Egyptologists pried open the black granite sarcophagus earlier today to reveal three decomposed bodies. The\\xa0stone coffin was also filled with sewage water, which is believed to have increased the rate of decomposition.\\xa0 The move was confirmed by Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt. Trepanation is a procedure which was done throughout human history. It involves removing a section of the skull and was often done on animals and humans.\\xa0 The first recorded proof of this was done on a cow in the Stone Age 3,000 years ago.\\xa0 It was a process that was still being conducted in the 18th century. The belief was that for many ailments that involved severe pain in the head of\\xa0 a patient, removing a circular piece of the cranium would release the pressure. Before then, dating back to the Neolithic era, people would drill or scrape a hole into the head of people exhibiting abnormal behaviour.\\xa0 It is thought that this would release the demons held in the skull of the afflicted.\\xa0\\xa0 'The sarcophagus has been opened, but we have not been hit by a curse, said Mr Waziri. None of the three mummies belong to a Ptolemaic or Roman royal family, as had previously been suggested, according to reports in Egypt Today.\\xa0 This conclusion is based on the coffins bearing no inscriptions or a cartouche displaying the occupant's names The lack of silver or gold metallic masks, statues, amulets or inscriptions also suggests they were not of high status. Mr Waziri said in a press statement at the time of discovery that one of the skulls showed signs of multiple fractures.\\xa0 He originally suggested that it had been hit by a sharp instrument and that it belonged to a soldier. He also said that the other two skulls were intact and male, with further studies expected to reveal their ages and appearances 'Preliminary examination suggests the skeletons belong to three army officers, one of them his skull shows an injury of an arrow,' Shaban Abd Monem, a specialist in mummies at the Ministry of Antiquities, told\\xa0Luxor Times. The three mummies were moved to the Alexandria National Museum, while the coffin was transferred to a military museum. The sarcophagus was uncovered inside an ancient tomb as well as a bust made from alabaster whose features had eroded into obscurity. Egyptologists at the time determined the tomb belonged to a nobleman as opposed to a king, The Daily Telegraph reported.\\xa0 Some historians believe Alexander's remains could one day be discovered on top of the modern city, which is built on the ancient settlement he established.\\xa0 Antiques ministry officials said at the time that the sarcophagus had been sealed for more than 2,000 years.\\xa0 An undisturbed layer of mortar sat between its lid and the body of the coffin. Questions as to the identity of the person inside arose due to the worn bust and the absence of any written inscriptions. Some said it belonged to a rich or noble man who lived between\\xa0323BC\\xa0and 30BC.\\xa0This was the time Rome seized Egypt and after the death of Cleopatra.\\xa0 The tomb was said to be 'too small' for a king like Alexander as bigger ones have been found to contain Roman nobles. When news it would be opened surfaced online, American author\\xa0Catherynne Valente joked: 'If the movies have taught me anything, guys, don't open that. Just don't. Leave it alone.'\\xa0 Elsewhere in\\xa0Egypt, archaeologists have also discovered an ancient pottery manufacturing workshop dating to more than 4,000 years ago. The Antiquities Ministry says the workshop is situated close to the Nile River in Aswan province in southern Egypt.\\xa0 It says the workshop, the oldest pottery workshop in the Old Kingdom, belongs to the 4th Dynasty, spanning 2,613 to 2,494BC.\\xa0 The Old Kingdom is also known as the age when pyramid-building flourished. Inside the workshop, archaeologists found an ancient pottery manufacturing wheel made of a limestone turntable and a hollow base. Mostafa Waziri added that the discovery was 'rare' and reveals more about the development of pottery manufacturing and the daily lives of ancient Egyptians during that time in history. The find follows another recent discovery in Egypt, in which\\xa0archaeologists uncovered an ancient mummification workshop dating back more than 2,500 years. Specialist stumbled across the find near Egypt's famed pyramids at an ancient necropolis south of Cairo. The discovery included a mummification workshop and a shaft, which was used as a communal burial place, located at the Saqqara necropolis of Memphis - the first capital of ancient Egypt. Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its vast necropolis are home to a wide range of temples and tombs as well as the three renowned Giza pyramids. The latest find, announced at a press conference Saturday, belongs to the Saite-Persian Period, from 664-404 B.C. The site, which lies south of the Unas pyramid, was last excavated more than 100 years ago, in 1900.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"We've all heard about the panic most parents have over keeping their kids occupied for the summer holidays, but for many mums and dads, the real stress has just begun. Why? Well, their little ones are about to take a huge leap in the growing-up stakes: primary school looms. For the majority of the last four years, you will have had your child at home but they'll soon be entering a world of timetables, routine and uniforms - and you'll probably be even more apprehensive about this big change than them! From picking out their first pair of school shoes to how you can cope at the school gate,\\xa0we have the low-down of everything you need to know about handling the next chapter... 1) Talk about the big day No matter how old we get, the unknown is always the scariest of prospects. So when it comes to a change like starting primary school, talking about the process in the months leading up to the big day will help demystify it. You can tell them all the exciting things that will happen - new friends, play times, learning loads of new stuff - as well as all the things that you loved about starting school. It also helps to drive past the new school so  they are aware where they're going rather than just arriving somewhere unknown on the first day.\\xa0 2) School shoes need to be comfortable Kids' imaginations are famously intrepid - and there's few adventures as big as primary school. From playing football with  friends to scooting home after that first day, your kids will be discovering a whole new world of exploration. And explorers need robust footwear! That's where Clarks Kids come in. A trusted family favourite for decades, Clarks Kids have put their new line - including the lightweight black leather\\xa0Crown Pride velcro shoe (£38)\\xa0or the comfortable patent leather Drew Star design (£44)\\xa0- through a staggering 60 tests to ensure you get value for money for one of your milestone pre-school purchases. Each design is rigorously checked, from opening velcro 400 times to checking a shoe's recovery  by compressing soles for a whole 24 hours, meaning you have one thing less to worry about. And the experts who put these shoes through their paces? Kids, of course! Selected schools wear the new designs for several months to make sure they are robust enough to last. Most of all - due in part to Clarks Kids' renowned foot-measuring technique - your child will feel comfortable and ready to tackle their new routine, setting a great foundation for their future.\\xa0 3) Label everything! Who doesn't remember their own parents sticking and stitching our names on everything? And while it seemed pointless back in the day, when there's 30 kids with the same jumper or cartoon lunchbox in the class, it's easy for things to go missing. Labelling can also help your child get excited by having them try on their freshly stamped new uniform with their moniker. But warning, they'll look so cute/grown up you may feel your bottom lip shaking... 4) Lunchboxes must be light work Ideally, every parent would love to send their child off to school with a gourmet lunch-box full of organic goodies but in reality, it needs to be simple and efficient -for both of your sakes. While you probably won't have eons of time to spend crafting hedgehogs out of apples in a morning, your kids also need to be able to eat things with ease; so that means drinks they can open themselves and food that doesn't need a pair of industrial-strength scissors to get the wrapping off. 5) Your new parent pals will probably change You'll feel as nervous as your child about the prospect of new pals. Try and talk to at least one other parent on the first morning but also know that you might not stay friends with them all the way through your child's school life. On the other hand, you may strike up instant bonds with other mums and dads. Either way, act like you want your child to act at school; be polite and nice to everyone! 6) Get to know the teacher... but not too much While Teacher's Pet has negative connotations, it's always best to make yourself known to your child's teacher. Say hello, make sure your child does their homework, and that you fill in their diary every evening. But also, know your boundaries - they are in your life to work together on your child's education, not to go to brunch with at the weekends! From scooting their way to school to walking on the moon during an imaginative break time, it's imperative as parents that we are there to help harness our kids' wonderment while keeping their feet on the ground. And a great place to start is with their foundations. The right school shoes will help them tackle their new adventure and flourish. That's why they need to be tough enough to take on the challenge while always being comfortable. For the first time ever, the experts at Clarks Kids through a staggering 60 tests to ensure they will go the distance. These tests include flexing the soles\\xa040,000 times, opening velcro straps 400 times and checking recovery time by compressing soles for a whole 24 hours. And the experts who put these shoes through their paces? Kids, of course. Selected schools wear the new designs for several months to make sure they are robust enough to last.\\xa0 Ideal for parents, who can spend up to four days looking for the perfect pair of school shoes, the new line covers the three main points; comfort, durability and quality. And with over 170 years of industry experience, quality is something which has always mattered to Clarks, making it the best place to help your children on their path through school. Check out the new rigorously tested new Clarks Kids range here\\xa0and follow them on Instagram at\\xa0@ClarksWow and @ClarksKids... 7) Volunteer - but not to your detriment Being on the Parent Teach Association is a hugely valuable job and puts you at the centre of your child's school community.\\xa0 But you also have to be ready for some hard work - you'll be dodged by other parents when you need someone to volunteer on fete stalls or bake cakes for the Christmas party. You might even get your own unflattering\\xa0acronym on certain forums! Long story short, do volunteer but don't get cornered into doing everything yourself because other parents haven't stepped up. 8) Read to your child every night... On the whole, our kids copy whatever we do. If you want yours to learn to read quickly, get them into books by reading them yourself. Take trips to the library and pick out ones that either you know they'll love or books with covers which catch their eye. Then cuddle up on the sofa and read together every evening.\\xa0 Not only will their literacy come on leaps and bounds from regular practise but it's the perfect way to make learning a relaxed and comfortable place for them.\\xa0 9) They will be exhausted While you'll want to be setting play dates and helping build up friendships with after-school clubs, your child will be wiped out in their first few weeks. That also means that they probably won't be that chatty after their first few days, so don't worry about getting a short 'fine' when you quiz them about how their day was. After all, the huge change in routine and the fact they are trying to fit in is exhausting. Scale back their activities for a while and just focus on the basics; dinner, bath, cuddle, story and bed.\\xa0 10) It will be emotional You will cry. Simple.\\xa0 Whether your child does or not doesn't matter, you will be full to the brim with emotions as you drop them off; pride, excitement, worry and probably a bit of unfounded guilt thrown in for good measure. The best way to deal with these is to see your child into the classroom, wave them off, don't linger and definitely wait until you're back in the car before you start blubbing!\\xa0\" => 1\n",

Canadian Russ Foxx, 36, has had over 100 body alterations ranging from ultraviolet tattoos to silicon horns implanted into his forehead. The body modification artist recently showcased some of the many uses for the chips that lie under his skin - including the ability to unlock a hand-made wooden concealment table 'hands free'. While the modifications are extreme, Mr Foxx says 'anyone who carries keys' could benefit from the chip implants - which are no larger than a grain of rice. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The process of implanting the self-installed RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near-field communication) transponders takes just a few seconds. According to Mr Foxx, who is from\\xa0Vancouver, Canada, the surgery is painless as the implants are just 2mm by 12mm in size. Requiring no batteries or charging, the chips are powered by electromagnetic induction generated when in close enough proximity to their designated readers. Once implanted, the glass-encased transponders cannot be seen, but can be felt underneath the skin. They are impervious to theft and are protected from any physical damage by the human body. Mr Foxx has replaced the keys to the ignition of his motorcycle and front door with chips that work in cohesion with specialised readers. Russ Foxx, from Vancouver, British Columbia, is a body modification artist and self-styled 'transhumanist'. He has had over 100 modifications applied to his body - from electrical key fobs fitted in his hand, to silicone horns implanted into his head. The 36-year-old full-time modifications artist has performed tens of thousands of procedures - many on himself. His own alterations include a forked snake tongue, ultraviolet tattoos and pointed ears. Other unconventional works include scarifications (a piece of art scratched into skin with the scarring healing into a piece of art) to an implanted 3D silicon scarab. He also has implants that can store data for him 'like a business card'. 'I identify as a cyborg and I see these implants as a means to interact with the world around me - anyone who carries keys could benefit equally from having these implants,' he said. 'Keys can be lost or stolen; implanted transponders make belongings more secure, they are impervious to theft and the body protects them from physical damage. 'Though I hope I'll never need them, I do keep backups of the transponders in case I were to ever lose my hand. 'Our bodies are a very effective defense against hacking. 'Implanting the chips has been both beneficial and fun - they have had no negative impact on my life whatsoever, they carry more benefits than they do risks. 'Having the RFID and NFC transponders fitted has certainly made storing data and accessing my secure places more convenient and personal - they have countless applications. 'Being chipped is quick, painless and fast to heal - they are small and easily removed, if desired. 'They save me time every single day - no more carrying around, forgetting or misplacing keys or having to remember access codes.' Mr Foxx said he is untroubled by the risks posed by his implants, such as concerns they could allow him to be tracked by hackers.\\xa0 After getting his ears pierced aged five, the now-36-year-old quickly became fascinated by the world of extreme aesthetic manipulation.

      "'TV’s Steph and Dom Parker, 51 and 53, draw on their 20 years of marriage to solve your relationship problems . . . Back in February, my lovely partner proposed to me. We’re in our mid-50s and it’s a second marriage for both of us. I was over the moon when he asked. But, since then, he has seemed reluctant to set a date. Every time I bring up wedding stuff, he says that there’s no rush and changes the subject. I’d managed to convince myself not to worry but, last month, a friend announced that she, too, was engaged — and they’re having a New Year wedding. Now everyone keeps asking me when mine is. The whole thing is just making my insecurities worse. Why is he taking so long to set a date? DOM SAYS: Congratulations — it’s wonderful when someone is fortunate enough to find love for a second time. You say your fiance is now reluctant to set a date — but you have to understand that men tend not to worry about the details of these things. We don’t generally dish out marriage proposals willy-nilly but, once we’ve done it, we do have a tendency to leave the actual arranging to others. And I do find myself thinking: ‘What’s the rush?’ I don’t want to disrespect your concern but, at your age — our age — we’re all slowing down a bit and there’s none of the mad dash of one’s 20s or 30s. You say your partner is ‘lovely’ and you sound very much in love. Is there any reason why the relationship can’t make you happy as it is? There’s nothing at all wrong with long-term couples who stay engaged for years or don’t get married full stop. It’s just possible he’s getting cold feet, but there are all sorts of potential reasons for that. Is he under financial pressure? Does he think you want hundreds of guests and it’s going to clean him out? It may be that he’s worried you’ll be disappointed with what he can offer, in which case I’d advise you suggest the far more romantic option of zipping off to Gretna Green, just the two of you. Or perhaps he’s most concerned about ruining what you have now. I also know couples who’ve got married after long relationships, only for it all to go horribly wrong within months of walking down the aisle. Fear of change may be holding him back. Either way, you’re going to have to talk to him like a grown-up and tell him you’ll understand if he’s having second thoughts — but you need to know why. He owes you that. And if he says his feet aren’t cold, he just doesn’t see the urgency, well, kick back and join him. He’s declared his undying love for you by asking you to marry him; a big commitment has already been made. How significant is a piece of paper or a ring really? Isn’t your relationship now, in the present, more important? Stop worrying — and enjoy your good fortune. STEPH SAYS: The thing to do here is to be brave and rip off the plaster! If he has had a change of heart, you need to give him a safe platform to deliver his news honestly. Start the conversation by sharing your wobbles. Tell him you’re feeling vulnerable. That always works, since showing a man your vulnerability is the greatest gift you can give him. Let him know that the lack of communication around your wedding is making you feel scared and see what he has to say. My hunch is he’s blissfully unaware that this is troubling you. But I wonder, too, if you are being honest with yourself about what is most bothering you about your situation. Are you really in a rush to get married or are you more upset because you think everyone is waiting for you to head down the aisle? You sound a little panicked and I do understand. You’ve told everyone you’re engaged to a lovely man: friends, family, your hairdresser, the lady on the supermarket checkout and all those people who pitied you when your first marriage ended — now, you want him to follow through with a wedding because, otherwise, you’ll look a bit of a fool. My advice is to stop worrying on that account, at least. You’re making the common mistake of believing everyone you know is scrutinising your life more than they really are. Most people are so preoccupied with their own problems, they don’t have time to judge you. Honestly, they won’t be gossiping at your apparent inability to drag your bloke down the aisle — they won’t give it a moment’s thought, other than to wish you luck for when you do get there. Your friend setting her own date has no relevance. No one is comparing you! I promise you, your fiance certainly isn’t. Men don’t operate in the same way over things like this; he won’t know that Friend A or B is getting married before you — and he won’t care. Nor, probably, will he understand how much work goes into a wedding and that getting organised early is key to its success. So take control of the situation, in a supportive way, and lay your cards on the table. And, if he wants to wait a little longer still, well, resist the urge to push him. Most people don’t celebrate a second — or third, fourth or fifth — marriage as much as the first and an extended engagement is perfectly acceptable. Setting a date is a matter for no one but you and your partner to decide — so why not take your time and enjoy each other?' => 1\n",

      "\"The face of an indigenous Canary Islander who lived more than 600 years ago has been recreated using forensic techniques and 3D scanning.\\xa0 Guanche people inhabited the archipelago between the first and 15th centuries, until the arrival of the Spanish empire. Settlers invaded the islands and the aboriginal people slowly went extinct and little trace of their civilisation was left behind.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Karina Osswald, of the University of Dundee, has now recreated the face of a Guanche woman using her skull. She said:\\xa0'The true identity of the Guanche people\\xa0has long remained a mystery – with the literary accounts of invading Spaniards being some of the only real information left about these intriguing indigenous people. 'During this project, I ended up learning so much about the Guanche and I hope her image will inspire others to find out more about this ancient population.' The exact age of the skull remains unknown but it predates the extinction of Guanche people 600 years ago. It was found in an unknown burial site on the Canaries around the 19th century and then donated to the University of Edinburgh Anatomical Museum. Ms Osswald\\xa0created the craniofacial reconstruction for her MSc Forensic Art and Facial Identification degree by taking 3D scans of the skull during a visit to the Anatomical Museum. Guanches were the aboriginal inhabitants of the Canary Islands.\\xa0They were hunter-gatherer tribes who lived a lifestyle much like it is supposed that people lived in the Stone Age. In 2017, the first genome-wide data from the Guanches confirmed they were of North African origin. There are suggestions that the light-skinned people descended from the Berbers of North Africa, possibly Libya. It is believed that they migrated to the archipelago around 1,000 BC from North Africa. What we do know of the mysterious people is derived from the work of Spanish Chroniclers and from archaeological discoveries.\\xa0 They were believed to have lived in caves and huts and had few tools due to the absence of ore to make metal on the volcanic islands.\\xa0 The native people had knowledge of basic farming and also made pottery.\\xa0 Quite like ancient Egyptians, the Guanches were known to embalm and mummify their dead. Dead Guanches of a higher social standing were left in caves whilst more lowly people were buried in the ground.\\xa0 Also like the Egyptians, although it is not known for sure, the Guanches may have made the mysterious pyramids strewn throughout Tenerife. There are several, with six in the town of Guimar. It is very possible the Guanches were responsible for the building of the structures as it is known they had basic knowledge of geometric shapes through their\\xa0‘pintaderas,’ which were some form of artistic seal made of pottery.\\xa0 The Guanches of Tenerife were split into nine kingdoms with a king known as a ‘mencey’ for each of these.\\xa0 The Guanches were the only native people known to have lived in the Macaronesian region before the arrival of Europeans, as there is no evidence that the other Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira) were inhabited before Europeans arrived.\\xa0 After the Spanish conquest of the Canaries they were ethnically and culturally absorbed by Spanish settlers, although elements of their culture survive to this day, intermixed within Canarian customs and traditions such as Silbo (the whistled language of La Gomera Island).\\xa0 The student said: 'What I've created is a best-guess estimate as to how one of these islanders would have looked. 'However, recent literature suggests that the appearances differed between each island of the Canary archipelago. 'This could mean, with further research, we may one day get a clearer idea of the individual differences between each Guanche island group.'

      "\"One of the Real Housewives of Cheshire has said parents shouldn't boast about their children's GCSEs results - for fear of upsetting children who didn't do well. Nervous pupils across the country will receive their GCSE results this morning, and speaking on Good Morning Britain, Leanne Brown, 40, argued that those with lower grades could feel 'inadequate' if they see parents bragging about their children getting top marks. Leanne is married to former Manchester United player Wes Brown and they have three daughters; Halle, 15, Lilia, 11, and six-year-old Lola.\\xa0 She was faced in the debate by parenting expert Liz Fraser, who said parents should be free to put whatever they want on their social media accounts. And her comments were criticised by GMB viewers, who said parents 'bursting with pride' should be able to say so. Leanne's\\xa0eldest child Halle will sit her GCSEs next year, but Leanne said she wouldn't speak about her results online for fear of upsetting her younger children. She explained: 'I just think at the end of the day be proud of your child. But to put the individual scores out there, I just think have a bit of consideration for the peers who may not have done as well.\\xa0 'My worry is if my eldest child, who is now 15, she's going to do her GCSEs next year, she may do well but if her siblings that are going to do their GCSEs don't do as well they might feel inadequate or feel pressure.' Under sweeping GCSE reforms in England, traditional A* to G grades have been replaced with a 9 to 1 system, with 9 the highest mark. In general, a grade 7-9 is roughly equivalent to A-A* under the old system, while a grade 4 and above is roughly equivalent to a C and above. Grade boundaries are set by exam boards after marking has taken place, to take account of how demanding the papers were. Here are the grade boundaries for some of the main subjects in the higher tier papers this year. Under exam board Edexcel (subject, grade 4 score, grade 7 score): She said parents who share results are 'boastful' and 'showing off', before accusing them of setting a bad example for their own children. Leanne continued: 'We try so much these days to tell our children not to compare themselves to others, especially on social media, I think that's so important and then what are they doing, the parents that do that? They're doing just that. 'I think it's setting a bad example, I don't see what a parent is getting from that other than showing off.' But parenting expert Liz Fraser disagreed, saying:\\xa0'Social media is your platform to put anything you want out there. It's inherently self interested isn't it?\\xa0 'Even if you comment on the news you're still putting your opinions on the news, even if you ask a question, it's about you.\\xa0 'It's our own little platform where we can share things or talk about things that are of interest to us.\\xa0 'If you don't like what I post on social media, whether that's about my children, my life, or my work, whatever it might be, you don't have to follow me, you don't have to look at it, it's absolutely fine.' Good Morning Britain viewers also disagreed, with many arguing that parents should be allowed to be proud of their children's success. One tweeted: 'Every parent has the right to shout out how proud they are of their children and that doesn't matter if they come out with 4s or 9s. If a child has worked hard and you are proud then sing it from the rooftops!' 'Really?? Be proud and loud, big your kids up if they do well!!' another posted.

      "\"Facebook has suspended more than 400 apps for harvesting users' personal information including the myPersonality app that was exposed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network said in an announcement on Wednesday that it was informing four million users that their information has been taken and shared by the myPersonality app alone.\\xa0 It did not say how many more users had been affect by the other 399 apps it has suspended.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Apps were suspended 'due to concerns around the developers who built them or how the information people chose to share with the app may have been used,' a company official said. Launched in March by Facebook, the app unit stemmed from the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. Facebook admitted that up to 87 million users may have had their data hijacked by Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The myPersonality app was banned by the social network for not agreeing to an audit and 'because it's clear that they shared information with researchers as well as companies with only limited protections in place.' The quiz, called myPersonality, collected highly sensitive data - including psychometric test results that reveal how neurotic or extrovert an individual may be. Run by the University of Cambridge, the myPersonality site was founded in 2007 and allowed users to take real psychometric tests and obtain their results instantly. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Facebook said it planned to notify the approximately four million members of the social network who shared information with myPersonality, which was active mostly prior to 2012.\\xa0 Ime Archibong, vice president of product partnerships at Facebook, said in a blog post said the app was banned for 'failing to agree to our request to audit and because it's clear that they shared information with researchers as well as companies with only limited protections in place.\\xa0 'As a result we will notify the roughly four million people who chose to share their Facebook information with myPersonality that it may have been misused.\\xa0 'Given we currently have no evidence that myPersonality accessed any friends' information, we will not be notifying these people's Facebook friends. Should that change, we will notify them', he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investigators found the information was poorly protected for four years and gaining access to it was relatively easy. MyPersonality was one of the 200 apps that were suspended from the social network back in May. Writing in a blog post updating on the investigation at the time, Mr Archibong said: 'We have large teams of internal and external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as possible. 'To date, thousands of apps have been investigated and around 200 have been suspended – pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data. 'There is a lot more work to be done to find all the apps that may have misused people's Facebook data – and it will take time,' he said. 'We are investing heavily to make sure this investigation is as thorough and timely as possible. 'We will keep you updated on our progress.' The leaked information from myPersonality gave access to the 'Big Five' personality scores, according to a report from New Scientist, who broke the news. These have been defined as openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism - sometimes abbreviated to OCEAN. After completing the test, each user was ascribed a unique ID which brought together all their information. This included age, gender, location, status updates and the results of the personality quiz. With all the information tied to one ID, finding the name of the person and demolishing anonymity could easily be achieved. Apps put on hold at the social network were being scrutinised more closely, according to Mr Archibong. Facebook has modified app data sharing policies since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. 'We will continue to investigate apps and make the changes needed to our platform to ensure that we are doing all we can to protect people´s information,' Mr Archibong said.

David Stillwell and Michal Kosinski of the University of Cambridge's The Psychometrics Centre were in charge of the database. Alexandr Kogan, an individual mired by the Cambridge Analytica fallout, was part of the project until 2014. David Stillwell has removed his Twitter and website in light of the investigation.\\xa0 Yesterday, Facebook also announced it will pull Onavo Protect virtual private network application from the App Store after getting word that it violates Apple's data collection rules. The free application creates an encrypted VPN connection that routes internet activity through computer servers managed and secured by Facebook.\\xa0 The app also alerts users when sites they visit might be malicious. Facebook is able to gather information about how people use smartphones outside of the leading social network's services, potentially gleaning insights about rivals or internet trends. 'We've always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used,' a Facebook spokeswoman told AFP. Communications firm Cambridge Analytica has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia. The company boasts it can 'find your voters and move them to action' through data-driven campaigns and a team that includes data scientists and behavioural psychologists. 'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. The company profited from a feature that meant apps could ask for permission to access your own data as well as the data of all your Facebook friends. This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so. This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. This information is said to have been used to help the Brexit campaign in the UK. 'As a developer on Apple's platform we follow the rules they've put in place.' Facebook did not comment regarding whether it is removing Onavo from the App Store. The Wall Street Journal cited an unnamed person close to the matter as saying the VPN could be removed from the Apple digital content shop. Onavo has been in the App Store for several years. Britain's data regulator said last month that it will fine Facebook half a million pounds for failing to protect user data, as part of its investigation into whether personal information was misused ahead of the Brexit referendum. The Information Commissioner's Office began investigating the social media giant earlier this year due to the Cambridge Analytica data mishandling. Cambridge Analytica has denied accusations and has filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Britain.

Silicon Valley-based Facebook last month acknowledged it faces multiple inquiries from regulators about the Cambridge Analytica user data scandal. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg apologized to the European Parliament in May and said the social media giant is taking steps to prevent such a breach from happening again. Zuckerberg was grilled about the breach in US Congress in April. Facebook says it is making advertising on the social network more 'transparent' by publishing more information about the adverts firms are running on the site. The social network has added a new feature which enables users to see the adverts any firm with a Facebook page is running on the site at that time and to report any adverts they believe are suspicious. Facebook said it would also start displaying more information about pages, even if they do not advertise, to give users a better understanding of their history. The firm said this information would include any recent name changes as well as information on when the page was created. Facebook confirmed it will add more information to this section in the 'coming weeks'. The new details on firms can be found by visiting its Facebook page and clicking on the 'Info and Ads' section. 'The vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organisations - whether it's a small business looking for new customers, an advocacy group raising money for their cause, or a politician running for office,' the social network said. 'But we've seen that bad actors can misuse our products, too. These steps are just the start - we're always looking for more ways to improve. 'By shining a bright light on all ads, as well as the pages that run them, we'll make it easier to root out abuse - helping to ensure that bad actors are held accountable for the ads they run.' Facebook has come under intense scrutiny over a wide range of its business practices, including how its advertising network is used for political purposes. Alongside the new transparency measures, Facebook said it would soon begin rolling out labeling for political advertising on the platform in Brazil, ahead of the country's general election in October.\" => 1\n",

      "\"Sixty nine major earthquakes have hit Earth's most active geological disaster zone in the space of just 48 hours. Sixteen 'significant' tremors - those at magnitude 4.5 or above - shook the Pacific 'Ring of Fire' on Monday, following a spate of 53 that hit the region Sunday. The quakes rattled Indonesia, Bolivia, Japan and Fiji, but failed to reach the western coast of the United States, which also falls along the infamous geological ring. The tremors have raised concerns that California's 'Big One' - a destructive earthquake of magnitude 8 or greater - may be looming. Scientists have previously warned that Ring of Fire activity may trigger a domino effect that sets off earthquakes and volcanic eruptions elsewhere in the region. California, which straddles the huge San Andreas Fault Line and sits on the eastern edge of the ring, is long overdue a deadly earthquake, researchers claim.\\xa0 Scroll down for video The recent spate of Ring of Fire activity was recorded by experts at the United States Geological Survey, which is headquartered in Reston, Virginia. Maps generated by the agency's vast array of seismometers shows Fiji was the worst hit, with five earthquakes above magnitude 4.5 - classed\\xa0as 'significant' by the USGS - rumbling the country since Monday morning. The largest of these was a 5.0 tremor that struck the region at 6:30am BST (1:30am ET) on Tuesday morning. An enormous 8.2 magnitude earthquake struck in the Pacific Ocean close to Fiji and Tonga on Sunday, but was too deep to cause any significant damage.\\xa0 The quake's depth at 347.7 miles (560 km) would have dampened the shaking at the surface.\\xa0 'We are monitoring the situation and some places felt it, but it was a very deep earthquake,' Director Apete Soro told Reuters.\\xa0 Indonesia was hit by seven significant earthquakes, while the Soloman Islands, Bolivia and the Tonga were each rocked by a single quake, on Monday. The nations often experience seismic activity as they sit along the Ring of Fire -a massive horseshoe-shaped area in the Pacific basin. The ring is formed of a string of 452 volcanoes and sites of high seismic activity that encircle the Pacific Ocean, including the entire US west coast. The (USGS) has not issued a warning over the recent shakes, meaning they do not pose an immediate risk to US citizens. Earth's so-called 'Ring of Fire' is a horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone that is a hot bed for tectonic and volcanic activity. Roughly 90 per cent of the world's earthquakes occur in the belt, which is also home to more than 450 volcanoes.\\xa0 The seismic region stretches along the Pacific Ocean coastlines, where the Pacific Plate grinds against other plates that form the Earth's crust. It loops from New Zealand to Chile, passing through the coasts of Asia and the Americas on the way.\\xa0 In total, the loop makes up a 25,000-mile (40,000-kilometre) -long zone prone to frequent earthquakes and eruptions. The region is susceptible to disasters because it is home to a vast number of 'subduction zones', areas where tectonic plates overlap. Earthquakes are triggered when these plates scrape or slide underneath one another, and when that happens at sea it can spawn tsunamis.\\xa0   But the recent jump in Ring of Fire activity may spark activity elsewhere in the region, including California. Professor Emily Brodsky, an Earth scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz, told Vox in February that volcanoes and earthquakes in the area 'can interact'.\\xa0 California was recently shaken by\\xa0a cluster of 11 earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 2.8 to 5.6 on the Richter scale. The cluster occurred last month on the seabed at the\\xa0Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, around six miles (10km) underwater off the US west coast. This plate forms part of the\\xa0Cascadia subduction zone, which runs\\xa0from Northern California to British Columbia.\\xa0 Seismologists say a full rupture along the 650-mile-long (1,000 km) offshore fault could trigger a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and an accompanying tsunami. Fears of a quake of this size, dubbed the 'Big One', were stirred last year by an expert who warned that a destructive earthquake will hit California 'imminently'. Seismologist Dr Lucy Jones, from the US Geological Survey, warned in a dramatic speech that people need to act to protect themselves rather than ignoring the threat. Dr Jones said people's decision not to accept it will only mean more suffer as scientists warn the 'Big One' is now overdue to hit California. In a keynote speech to a meeting of the Japan Geoscience Union and American Geophysical Union, Dr Jones warned that the public are yet to accept the randomness of future earthquakes. People tend to focus on earthquakes happening in the next 30 years but they should be preparing now, she warned. The magnitude of an earthquake differs from its intensity. The magnitude of an earthquake refers to the measurement of energy released where the earthquake originated. Magnitude is calculated based on measurements on seismographs. The intensity of an earthquake refers to how strong the shaking that is produced by the sensation is. According to the United States Geological Survey, 'intensity is determined from the effects on people, human structures and the natural environment'. Earthquakes originate below the surface of the earth in a region called the hypocenter.\\xa0 During an earthquake, one part of a seismograph remains stationary and one part moves with the earth's surface. The earthquake is then measured by the difference in the positions of the still and moving parts of the seismograph.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "'There was a time when Jaeger was going to be the next Burberry. A heritage brand ripe for a Cool Britannia reinvention. In 2008, when sales topped £80 million, Jaeger held its first show at London Fashion Week and Kate Moss wore its star-print blouse. The twinset-and-pearls reputation that had dogged the company since the Nineties was all but snuffed out. And then? Jaeger almost went bust — twice — in 2011 and 2017. But Philip Day, owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, swooped in and saved Jaeger (est. 1884) from oblivion last year, after decades of management turmoil, yo-yo-ing finances and behind-the-scenes battles (former owner Harold Tillman is suing Lloyds bank, claiming Jaeger was ‘taken’ from him). The boardroom might be in better shape for now, but on the shop floor, well — when was the last time you popped into a store? (If you could find one: 20 branches were closed last April). If Jaeger hasn’t slipped off your shopping radar, it’s become synonymous with smart but slightly boring pieces. Too expensive for a lunchtime shopping fix, too sensible for fashion-lovers with cash to splash. However, Jaeger’s new autumn-winter collection could be about to revive the brand’s desirability. What better way to recapture its Fifties/Sixties heyday — a time when they dressed Audrey Hepburn, and David Bailey shot their advertising campaigns — than to take inspiration from this golden era? Key heritage pieces have been thoughtfully modernised: a classic double-breasted jacket comes with matching cropped culottes, a checked A-line midi-skirt gets a contrast panel, boucle jackets remain but are cleaned of fussy buttons or twee detailing. ‘It’s about being proud of what we’ve done — and making it relevant,’ says Jaeger’s head of product design Liza Canneford, who, along with womenswear designer Stephanie Teigh, plundered the brand’s archive of sketches and marketing material at Westminster Library. ‘Jaeger has been through a tough time. But it’s like every woman’s life — it has its ups and downs. You have to re-find yourself and get back on track.’ Eye-catching pieces include a pencil skirt in champagne sequins, and satin pyjama-style separates in a black and gold floral. The hero piece Jaeger is trumpeting is the pale pink mohair coat, inspired by a 1957 Jaeger design. ‘There’s an incredible image by photographer Norman Parkinson, who shot Anne Gunning wearing the coat for Vogue in 1956: she’s in India, standing by an elephant,’ says Liza. Now the original design has been tweaked, playing with the shape of the collar and adjusting the proportions to be less voluminous. It’s a serious contender for ‘It Coat’ of the season. But can one great item really resuscitate a whole brand? ‘It can work brilliantly — if they’ve chosen the right product,’ says Kate Ancketill, CEO of retail innovation consultancy GDR Creative Intelligence. ‘Think Burberry’s trench, or Levi’s 501s. It becomes a metaphor for the history and craftsmanship that permeates the brand.’ She says ‘lacklustre design’ has previously let down the retailer, but also thinks Jaeger needs to re-establish its position. ‘They’ve slumped into the middle market. I’m guessing their target is the woman who buys from Sportmax, Joseph or Winser London, who all do the “high-quality fashionable classics” really well. ‘However, I suspect they’re actually in competition with John Lewis and M&S more often than they’d like.’ That’s a problem: Jaeger’s pink coat is £335 — very expensive indeed if you’re comparing it to M&S’s offering. In Jaeger’s new collection, jackets hover around the £150 mark and knitwear £125. Liza is keen to stress the value that Jaeger’s designs represent: ‘If I’m asking someone to spend £300 on a coat, I am 100 per cent confident that she will get incredible value — because it’s the best fabric, it’s beautifully cut, and will last for ever.’ Still, competition for the nation’s credit cards is stiff. ‘The space Jaeger occupies is increasingly crowded,’ says Richard Hyman, a retail strategist. ‘The line-up today includes Hobbs, Ted Baker, Karen Millen, Reiss, L.K.Bennett, Jigsaw — all fighting for a share of spend in the premium High Street.’ For now, Jaeger lives to fight another day — while wearing the perfect pink coat, of course.' => 1\n",

      "\"A mother who weighs 16st more than her husband has revealed how their 'mixed weight relationship' is perfect. Emma and Stuart Grundy from Hyde, Manchester have been together since they were teenagers after meeting at their local supermarket. The pair - who have been married for two years - claim they are complete opposites in every way, but that they're perfect for one another because Stuart in love with Emma's personality, which has never changed over the years. Stuart, 32, who is quiet and reserved, with a slim 9st build, was attracted to 30-year-old Emma's loud and bubbly personality instantly and has never had an issue with her 25st frame. And the unlikely duo went viral earlier this week after Emma posted online about their 'mixed weight relationship' online, stating 'he's thin and I'm fat but that's how we roll.' Emma felt she needed to speak out about their relationship to show that although they may not look compatible they couldn't be happier. The full time mother-of-three said: 'I've always been bigger than Stuart but after having three kids I have put on more weight. 'At my heaviest I weighed 27st stone but Stuart has always been no more than 9st. 'It has never bothered us that I'm bigger than Stuart as we're both so happy and in love with each other. 'When I first met Stuart I was attracted to how shy he was as that wasn't my usual type and after our first date as teenagers we've been inseparable ever since. 'I think it's important to show others how happy we are as although some people might think we don't look compatible we couldn't have a better relationship. 'We both just feel so lucky and grateful to have met each other and there's no reason why any mixed weight relationship wouldn't work. 'We've never had any backlash about our size differences but we're not bothered by anyone's negative opinion anyway as they're irrelevant. 'I think it's obvious from all of our photos together that we're madly in love.' After writing a post on Facebook about being in a 'mixed weight relationship' Emma - who is currently a size 26 - received dozens of supportive messages. She added: 'It was so lovely to read so many lovely messages about how great we looked together. 'I don't think anyone is ever happy no matter their size and I've accepted I'll never be skinny. 'Stuart has always said he loves me no matter what size I am as my personality has never changed since we met as teenagers. 'I am really confident with my appearance and I have no issues with being bigger than Stuart. 'I hope other women embrace being bigger than their partners as there's so much more to life than being slim and dieting. 'We are a very happy family and along with our three children, Evie-Mai, eight, Ollie, six and Bonnie-Lou, 10 months, we have the best home life together. 'I think it's important to share stories like ours to break down the stigmas attached to women being a certain size.'\" => 1\n",

      "\"Watching Aleksandar Mitrovic battle with the big boys of Burnley, you got the sense these are the games he circles on his calendar at the start of the season. Forget your trips to Manchester United or Liverpool. These are the matches that matter to Mitrovic, the ones where the born bruiser can do what he does best. From the first minute to the last, Mitrovic had Sean Dyche's Burnley on a string, scoring twice and inspiring Fulham to their first Premier League win in 1,597 days. Supported superbly by Andre Schurrle and Jean Michael Seri, the home side's two other scorers, the 23-year-old ran Ben Mee and James Tarkowski ragged. Finally, Slavisa Jokanovic's Fulham are up and running, courtesy of their Serbian battler who some felt would not be able to cut it in the top flight. 'I didn't watch Mitro at Newcastle,' Jokanovic said. 'We believe he's a quality player. 'Some people are thinking he can only be a Championship player. No, he showed the quality for fighting in the highest level in England and in the world. He's a really important player. He's a young man, still only 23, and has huge room for improvement ahead.' Fulham (4-3-3): Bettinelli 6.5; Fosu-Mensah 7, Odoi 7, Le Marchand 7, Bryan 7 (Chambers 71); Seri 7.5, McDonald 7, Cairney 7 (Anguissa 78); Schurrle 7.5 (Sessegnon 89), Mitrovic 8, Vietto 7.5 Subs not used: Fabri, Johansen, Christie, Kamara Scorers: Seri 4, Mitrovic 36, 38, Schurrle 83 Booked: Schurrle, Bettinelli Manager: Slavisa Jokanovic 7 Burnley (4-4-1-1): Hart 5; Lowton 5, Mee 4.5, Tarkowski 5, Ward 4 (Vokes 66, 5); Lennon 5.5, Cork 5, Westwood 5, Gudmundsson 5.5 (Taylor 19, 6); Hendrick 6; Wood 5.5 (Barnes 66, 5.5) Subs not used: Heaton, Gibson, Bardsley, Long Scorers: Hendrick 10, Tarkowski 41 Booked: Tarkowski Manager: Sean Dyche 5 Referee: David Coote 6 Attendance: 23,438 What Jokanovic found particularly satisfying was the way in which Fulham won. They looked like a cohesive team rather than a collection of individuals and did not compromise their short, sharp passing style of play. At times, Burnley seemed to have adopted more of an 'ave it approach. It was not easy on the eye, their heavy legs were evident and the defending was very un-Dyche like. They have now conceded 10 goals in three games and, thanks to their Europa League travels, this was their eighth competitive fixture of the season already. That will take its toll on any team and given the size of their squad, the Thursday-to-Sunday schedule is clearly having an impact. As a result, Dyche made six changes to his side for this. The slick surface suited Fulham more and within four minutes, they had the lead. Seri, the midfielder signed from Nice for £25million in the summer, was just short of 30 yards when he received the ball and shifted it to his right. He let rip a shot that raced into the top corner, and while Joe Hart threw himself in the air, the Burnley goalkeeper could get nowhere near it. England manager Gareth Southgate, in attendance at Craven Cottage, will not have held that one against Hart. He may have had issues with the others that followed. On the 10-minute mark, Burnley got themselves back in it. A loose pass by Maxime Le Marchand gifted possession to Aaron Lennon, who sprinted then squared the ball to Jeff Hendrick. It looked like the forward had taken too long when his initial shot was blocked by Denis Odoi, but Hendrick got a second opportunity and scored. Fulham had their lead back after 36 minutes when Seri took a corner short and Tom Cairney crossed, finding Mitrovic at the back post. Untroubled, he headed home. Two minutes later, it was that man again. A cross by Luciano Vietto was inviting and Mitrovic headed beyond Hart a second time. More lazy marking by Burnley. The visitors had it all to do, though they gave themselves a lifeline ahead of half time. A Charlie Taylor corner and a header by Mee led to a Tarkowski tap-in. After the break, Schurrle kissed the crossbar with a curling shot from the corner of the 18-yard box. The German was later fortunate to avoid a straight red when he lunged in on Ashley Westwood after losing control of the ball. Referee David Coote decided a yellow sufficed. Dyche disagreed. In the 73rd minute, Mitrovic came agonisingly close to securing his hat-trick when he slid in to meet a Timothy Fosu-Mensah cross. He was inches away as the ball skidded by him. Schurrle could have wrapped things up when he had only Hart to beat. An outstretched leg from the former Manchester City man denied Fulham their fourth goal – for now. Moments later, Mitrovic struck a low shot from 20 yards that smacked the woodwork. Schurrle gladly picked up the rebound, composed himself and got the goal his performance deserved. Even in the five minutes of stoppage time, with Fulham two goals to the good, Mitrovic could be seen busting a gut to get the ball back. He had hounded Burnley's defenders all afternoon, and Fulham are off the mark.\\xa0\" => 0\n",

He cast blame on the government for failing to adequately safeguard the country from election meddling and cited Microsoft's removal of six webpages believed to be linked to Russian phishing attempts, as well as Facebook's announcement that it had taken down 652 accounts linked to Iran and Russia, as evidence that actors haven't been deterred from interfering. Scroll down for video 'The revelations are evidence that Russia has not been deterred and that Iran is following in its footsteps,' Stamos wrote.\\xa0 'This underlines a sobering reality: America’s adversaries believe that it is still both safe and effective to attack U.S. democracy using American technologies and the freedoms we cherish. '...In short, if the United States continues down this path, it risks allowing its elections to become the World Cup of information warfare, in which U.S. adversaries and allies battle to impose their various interests on the American electorate,' he added.\\xa0 Stamos called out current and past administrations, as well as Congress, for having a 'sclerotic response' that has left the US 'profoundly vulnerable to future attacks.' At best, the US has indicated that anyone who attempts to infiltrate our democratic process will get a 'slap on the wrist,' Stamos said.\\xa0 But in other ways, America has 'broadcast to the world that it doesn't take these issues seriously,' he added.\\xa0\\xa0 Still, Stamos acknowledged that he feels a 'personal responsibility for the failures of 2016,' having been the security leader at Facebook at the time. 'Social media platforms, including my former employer, made serious mistakes in 2016,' Stamos wrote.\\xa0 'Tech companies were still using a definition of cyber-warfare focused on traditional hacking techniques—such as spear-phishing or the spreading of malware—and were not prepared to detect and mitigate the propaganda campaigns that were subsequently found and stopped.'\\xa0 Earlier this month, Stamos announced he was leaving Facebook to teach and conduct research at Stanford.\\xa0 Google, Twitter and Facebook have come under fire for allowing the spread of bogus news - some of which was directed by Russia - ahead of the 2016 US election and in other countries.\\xa0 In a blog post in September 2017, Facebook said that more than 3,000 advertisements posted between June 2015 and May 2017 had Russian links. These ads came from a Russian company called Internet Research Agency. According to CNN, Russia-linked Facebook ads were targeted to reach people living in Michigan and Wisconsin, both of which were won narrowly by Trump. Facebook told Congress that the apparent political meddling included use of its image-sharing application Instagram. Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch told a hearing that Instagram posts by suspect Russian accounts were seen by some 20 million Americans last year. The data on Instagram is on top of the estimated 126 million Americans exposed to Facebook posts from Russian entities seeking to create divisions during the election campaign. 'I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust,' Zuckerberg said. 'What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it.'

      "\"Elon Musk has shared new details about Tesla's plans to go private.\\xa0 Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has approached Musk 'several times' about taking Tesla private, in conversations that stretch back as far as two years ago, Musk wrote in a blog post Monday. Sovereign wealth funds are investment funds that are controlled by the government. They can invest globally in stocks, bonds, real estate and other areas.\\xa0 It follows a shock announcement from the Tesla boss last week, when he tweeted that he was considering taking the firm private at $420 per share, adding that funding was 'secured.' Shares of Tesla were sliding more than 1 percent to $351.80 on Monday morning.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The surprise tweets have since caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with regulators looking into whether the statements were truthful and why Musk announced them via Twitter.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Additionally, Musk and Tesla are being sued by investors who claim the plan to go private was part of a 'fraudulent scheme' to punish short-sellers, or investors who borrow stock in a company with the hope shares will fall.\\xa0 The plaintiffs also allege that Musk's announcements artificially inflated Tesla's stock price and violated securities laws.\\xa0 Musk attempted to clear up his tweets in the blog post Monday.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0 'Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,' Musk wrote in the blog post.\\xa0 'They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to diversify away from oil. 'They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction,' Musk added.\\xa0 Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, or Public Investment Fund (PIF), is a state-run organization that invests in\\xa0stocks, bonds, real estate and other areas. The investment vehicle is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud. In recent years, the fund has been trying to diversify its investments away from oil, as part of Saudi Arabia's effort to broaden its economy. The fund now aims to raise its assets from $250 billion under management to $400 billion by 2020. It has purchased stakes in ride-hailing giant Uber and Lockheed Martin, pledged to invest in Blackstone and partnered with Japanese investment giant SoftBank to create the SoftBank Vision Fund.\\xa0 The fund also invested $1 billion in Virgin Galactic's Space Ventures unit. Last week, it was revealed that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund took a 5 percent stake in Tesla, which may pave the way for a larger stake, or outright buyout, in the future.\\xa0\\xa0 Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund met with Musk on July 31 after purchasing a 5 percent stake in Tesla. During the meeting, the fund's managing director reiterated a desire to fund a going private transaction for Tesla, Musk wrote.\\xa0 'I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,' he added.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 'This is why I referred to “funding secured” in the August 7th announcement.' Musk said that Tesla is still in the early stages of the take-private process and that the firm continues to meet with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. He added that he continues to hold conversations with Tesla's largest shareholders and that a deal would be funded primarily by equity, instead of debt. 'The $420 buyout price would only be used for Tesla shareholders who do not remain with our company if it is private,' he explained.\\xa0 'My best estimate right now is that approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.' The Tesla board has already met 'several times' in the past few weeks to discuss the proposal to take the firm private. Still, Musk felt it was necessary to inform all of Tesla's shareholders and announce his 'intentions publicly' on Twitter. 'The only way I could have meaningful discussions with our largest shareholders was to be completely forthcoming with them about my desire to take the company private,' Musk said.\\xa0 'However, it wouldn’t be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time. 'As a result, it was clear to me that the right thing to do was announce my intentions publicly.' Musk explained in the blog post that he will continue to talk with investors, while he 'investigates a range of potential structures and options.'\\xa0 In a shock announcement on Tuesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he has weighed taking the electric car company private at $420 a share.\\xa0 A take-private price of $420 a share would value Tesla at $82 billion and marks a significant jump from the stock's current levels of roughly $379 a share. Going private involves a transaction(s) that take a company off the public market, meaning retail investors can no longer trade shares on the stock market.\\xa0 Take-private transactions may be led by a non-controlling shareholder, a private equity firm making a leveraged buyout or a consortium of companies.\\xa0 Musk said he has received broad investor support for the move. The only thing standing in the way of an official announcement is a shareholder vote.\\xa0 Going private would allow Tesla to avoid many of the pressures of the public markets, such as wild stock swings, scrutiny from Wall Street analysts, as well as 'attacks' from short-sellers - a group that Musk has said 'want [Tesla] to die so bad they can taste it.'\\xa0 In a letter to employees, Musk said Tesla's volatile stock has served as a 'major distraction' to staff and that being public created a lot of pressure on the company to 'make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term.'\\xa0 If Tesla goes private, it would no longer be forced to file public financial statements or host quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street analysts.\\xa0 These events tend to cause upward or downward swings in Tesla's stock.\\xa0 'If and when a final proposal is presented, an appropriate evaluation process will be undertaken by a special committee of Tesla’s board, which I understand is already in the process of being set up, together with the legal counsel it has selected,' Musk explained.\\xa0 'If the board process results in an approved plan, any required regulatory approvals will need to be obtained and the plan will be presented to Tesla shareholders for a vote.' The blog post comes follows a wild week for Tesla's stock, with shares initially rising close to 12 percent on Tuesday, then falling about 2 percent on the news that the SEC was investigating Musk's tweets.\\xa0 Reports have suggested that the SEC's investigation has 'intensified' its probe into Musk and Tesla.\\xa0 Regulators are looking into whether Musk's tweets violated the SEC's fair disclosure rules, which include some provisions around posting material announcements on social media platforms and whether that is an example of market manipulation.\\xa0\\xa0 Securities lawyers told Bloomberg that Musk's tweets about a take-private transaction for Tesla are unlikely to violate any laws unless they're proven false or inaccurate.\\xa0 Musk's blog post on Monday will likely help prove that the tweets were accurate.\\xa0\\xa0 Should Musk decide to take Tesla private at $420 share, it would mark one of the largest buyouts in history.\\xa0 Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweets about the firm going private have reportedly drawn a closer look from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\xa0 The SEC is now looking at whether what Musk said was truthful and why he announced the information on his Twitter.\\xa0 The regulatory agency has certain rules around what companies can and cannot speak about on social media platforms, as part of its fair disclosure rules.\\xa0 Many believe Musk's tweets are likely to be weighed against the Reed Hastings Rule, which was established in 2012.\\xa0 The rule was established when Netflix CEO Reed Hastings used his Facebook to post that the streaming service had 'exceeded 1 billion hours for the first time.'\\xa0 This warranted further investigation by SEC regulators, who later determined that posting material information on social media is allowed.\\xa0 However, companies must make sure that shareholders are notified that material announcements will be made on social media channels, as well as given proper access to them.\\xa0 In Musk's case,\\xa0Tesla has only told investors to monitor the CEO’s Twitter feed in a public filing once, back in 2013.\\xa0 Beyond that, regulators will be working to find out whether Musk's claims were honest.\\xa0 Musk tweeted that financing had been secured for a take-private deal and that the company had received broad investor support.\\xa0 If Tesla doesn't have the funding in place, experts say Musk's tweets could amount to market manipulation, since it would be an example of false statements causing the company's shares to skyrocket.\\xa0 In a letter to shareholders after his tweet on Tuesday, Musk fleshed out his idea, suggesting they would get the option to sell their shares for $420 each or remain investors in a private Tesla, out of the glare of Wall Street and its need for quarterly results. He said that would allow Tesla to 'operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible.'

      "\"People admire those who are selfless and considerate but don't want them as friends or romantic partners, scientists have found.\\xa0 Researchers from the University of Oxford and Yale University found people want others to prioritise their company over anything else - no matter how amicable the distraction.\\xa0 They found that people who choose to spend time with their mum are more appealing as prospective friends and romantic partners than people who opt to build homes for the needy. Scroll down for video\\xa0 'When helping strangers conflicts with helping family and kin, people prefer those who show favouritism, even if that results in doing less good overall,' said Yale's Molly Crockett, assistant professor of psychology and senior author of the study.\\xa0 The researchers created scenarios designed to test a tough moral dilemma based on helping one person close to them or helping lots of strangers.\\xa0 For example, they asked whether a grandmother who wins a substantial amount of money in the lottery should give it to her grandson to fix his car, or to a charity dedicated to combating malaria. The researchers also asked if the would rather date a young woman who spends the day with her lonely mother or a young woman who volunteers with Habitat for Humanity, an organisation that builds homes for the poor and needy around the world. Participants in the study viewed both choices as equally moral but when it came to looking for a spouse or a friend, they preferred those who helped their grandson or spent the day with mother. 'Friendship requires favoritism - the key thing about friendship is that you treat your friends in a way you don't treat other people,' said Oxford's Jim Everett, first author of the study, which was published in the\\xa0Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. 'Who would want a friend who wouldn't help you when you needed it?' This preference was\\xa0reduced when participants were asked about qualities they wanted in a boss. It then completely\\xa0disappeared when people were asked about desired traits in a political leader as the role requires impartiality. 'A political leader who represented the interests of themselves or their family over the country would be disastrous,' Dr Everett said. According to the researchers, these findings suggest a roadblock for 'effective altruists'. These individuals argue people should donate money to a charity to help relieve poverty and disease in the developing world rather than to a local group that would help fewer people.\\xa0 A relationship can have many downfalls but\\xa0'marriages often die more by ice than by fire' says leading relationship expert Dr Michael McNulty. Couples drift apart and this often leads to break-ups. The first steps that lead to couples drifting apart in a break-up can be broken down as follows:\\xa0 Stage one: More negativity than positivity seeps into the relationship. Stage two: The four horsemen of the apocalypse - Contempt, criticism, defensiveness and stonewalling all contribute to a poisonous relationship. Stage three: Flooding - The stage where anger starts coming out in the relationship and the partners become highly emotional. Stage four: Emotional disengagement - After the vast amount of emotional unrest before this is where the relationships becomes stale, with both parties checking out already.\\xa0 \" => 1\n",

The brand, best known for the AK-47 machine gun, presented the decidedly retro-looking pale blue prototype, the CV-1, at a defence expo outside Moscow. The car looks just like a Lada car and was inspired by a Soviet hatchback model developed in the 1970s called 'Izh-Kombi,' a statement on the Kalashnikov website said. The car has a maximum power of 500 kW with a maximum speed of 80km per hour (50mph).\\xa0The company says it can go from 0 to 60pmh in six seconds.\\xa0\\xa0 However, reports suggest the spokesperson was unable to name any specific advantages the CV-1 had over a Tesla.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0 Holding company Kalashnikov Concern said it has developed some cutting-edge elements for the 'electric supercar'.\\xa0\\xa0 This includes\\xa0 a 'revolutionary' inverter which is a\\xa0device that uses the car battery to power electrical appliances.\\xa0 The vehicle can travel 350km (220 miles) on one charge. 'We are developing our own concept of an electric supercar, which is based on several original systems developed by the concern,' the firm said. 'This technology will let us stand in the ranks of global electric car producers such as Tesla and be their competitor,' RIA-Novosti news agency further quoted the Kalashnikov press service as saying. 'We were inspired by the experience of global market leaders in developing our concept.'\\xa0 The car is still being developed and it is not clear how much it will be or when it will be available to buy.\\xa0 Kalashnikov Concern has long been trying to expand its brand, recently launching lines of clothing and other civilian merchandise ranging from umbrellas to mobile phone covers. Its foray into electric vehicles however was met with mixed reactions from Russians.\\xa0 Comments to the news on the company's official Facebook page ranged from 'cyberpunk' to 'Izh-Zombie'. \\xa0The AK-47's story truly began in 1942, when Soviet soldiers seized new-style automatic rifles from German troops. Unlike traditional or semi-automatic rifles, they could fire a whole magazine of bullets simply by holding down the trigger, because the recoil from each shot ejected the previous cartridge. Entrenched in the conflict of the Second World War, the Soviets set to work straight away on copying the Nazis' designs. But their first versions were clunky, weighing more than 5kg without bullets, and the task of creating a new design fell to Mikhail Kalashnikov, who had created an unsuccessful gun prototype earlier in the war. His design mashed together the best elements of previous weapons and won a competition in 1946, going into full production the next year. Accuracy was not its strongest point but it endured for its simplicity and reliability in even the harshest of conditions - built, as it was, in the wilds of Siberia. It was not patented - opening the door for millions of 'pirate' versions - because of the culture which existed in the Communist state. All ideas were property of the government, not one individual person, and pride came from helping the great Soviet army.

Tesla's released its new Model 3 electric car in July 2017 with a batch of 30 vehicles sold exclusively to members of staff. The affordable £27,000 ($35,000) five-seat vehicle travels 215 miles (346km) on a single charge and accelerates from zero to 60mph (0-100kmh) in under six seconds. Although the eco-friendly car is one of Tesla's more affordable models, those looking to buy the vehicle may be waiting months before they can get behind the wheel. Tesla had struggled to meet the impressive demand for its vehicle, with a reported 500,000 pre-orders put in so far. Tesla has repeatedly missed production goals for Model 3, meaning those who have put down a £712 ($1,000) deposit for one of the vehicles may still have to wait until the end of 2018 to get their hands on it. Tesla missed its production goal for 2017's third quarter, producing only 260 vehicles compared to an earlier estimate of 1,500. As a result, the company's shares fell 5.4 per cent in after hours trading on November 1. Tesla said it delivered 26,150 vehicles total in the third quarter, a 4.5 per cent rise on the same period of 2016.

      "'A bottle of wine and two Real Madrid shirts in a plastic bag was all it took to convince Mauricio Pochettino of Jose Mourinho\\'s real character, away from the pantomime villain often portrayed. Pochettino, a novice coach in charge of Espanyol at the time, lost to Mourinho\\'s Real but the Portuguese had asked around for his opposite number\\'s favourite poison. He brought him a bottle of red from the renowned Chateau Cos d\\'Estournel in Bordeaux, along with two signed shirts for Pochettino\\'s sons. It was instant friendship. Time permitting, the pair will share another post-match tipple on Monday night, just at a time when Mourinho could use all the friends he can find at Old Trafford. Pochettino has seen the stories coming out of Manchester United in recent weeks, from Mourinho\\'s problems with Ed Woodward, to Paul Pogba to Pep Guardiola to the press. Yet his opinion has not changed. The Tottenham manager believes Mourinho is and always will be the right man for any big job, because he inspired each and every young coach in football. \\'For every single manager who is younger than him, he was an inspiration,\\' Pochettino said. \\'For everyone. Of course. I took a lot of things from him. So many things. He is an unbelievable manager. \\'I am younger than him, of course. The circumstances that happen with me, that happen with other managers, they will happen, it is up and down. \\'He is an inspirational manager for a manager like me. I have a very good relationship with \"Mou\" from when I was a manager of Espanyol and I have full respect for him and the club.\\'\\xa0 On paper, it is not a friendship you might have expected. Pochettino, after all, favours an exciting, entertaining style of play and has few enemies in football. Mourinho is more cautious, and can start an argument in an empty room. The Argentine has sympathy for his counterpart, however, explaining that all coaches feel \\'exposed\\' because their decisions are dissected on a daily basis, not least by their own fans. \\'When you lose, you feel the responsibility,\\' Pochettino said. \\'I am the manager. I assume responsibility. Always my thoughts are, \"You can do better\". Never is it enough. \\'Even when you win, you can do better. That is the mentality. To win, it is every day, it is here on the training ground in every single situation.\\' Old Trafford is the only ground where Pochettino has yet to pick up a point — or even score a goal — with Tottenham. In four visits there they have left empty-handed. On Monday they travel to the Theatre of Dreams with Toby Alderweireld in their squad, though the centre back could easily have been wearing red rather than white. Mourinho\\'s priority in the summer window was to sign a central defender and Alderweireld topped the list, but chief executive Woodward and United\\'s board did not deliver. The Belgian was known to be interested in the move to Manchester, although Pochettino insists all is forgiven and forgotten.

      "\"'The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means,' says Oscar Wilde's Miss Prism. Football, sadly, isn't like fiction. Good teams can be unlucky; rotten, negative, teams can get away with murder. Sunday, however, justice was done. The player that Newcastle tried to kick off the park scored Chelsea's opener; the player that could have been sent-off for elbowing an opponent put Chelsea's winner through his own net. The team that traveled away and tried to win got three points.\\xa0 The team that enjoyed less than 20 per cent of the ball playing at home got nothing. Newcastle do not have Chelsea's resources, we know that, but Brighton are a few quid short of Manchester United too, and that did not curb their ambition eight days ago.\\xa0 Newcastle (5-4-1): Dubravka 6.5; Yedlin 6.5, Fernandez 7, Schar 5.5 (Muto 79, 6), Clark 6.5, Dummett 6.5; Ritchie 6, Diame 6, Ki 6, Murphy 5 (Perez 74, 5); Rondon 5.5 (Joselu 62, 7) Subs not used: Sterry, Darlow, Atsu, Longstaff Booked: Schar, Fernandez, Ritchie Goal: Joselu 83 Manager: Rafa Benitez 5\\xa0 Chelsea (4-3-3): Arrizabalaga 6; Azpilicueta 7, Rudiger 7, Luiz 6, Alonso 7..5; Kante 6.5, Jorginho 7, Kovacic 7 (Barkley 79, 5); Pedro 6 (Willian 69, 6), Morata 5.5 (Giroud 65, 7), Hazard 8 Subs not used: Loftus-Cheek, Caballero, Zappacosta, Christensen Booked: Kovacic Goals: Hazard pen 76, Yedlin og 87 Manager: Maurizio Sarri 7\\xa0 Referee: Paul Tierney 7 MOM: Hazard Att: 51,791 Newcastle were unlucky against Tottenham on the opening day of the season but not here. They got what they deserved from this match as did Chelsea, whose 100 per cent record under Maurizio Sarri has been maintained.\\xa0 This was a determined performance in difficult circumstances, given the way Newcastle tried to nullify Eden Hazard by fair means or foul. He rose above it, the best player on the pitch and one who never stopped trying to take Newcastle on, no matter the battering he received. The win was controversial, according to the locals. They left complaining bitterly about referee Paul Tierney and the penalty award, and cursing the rotten luck that befell DeAndre Yedlin with two minutes of normal time remaining, but these are red herrings. The penalty was a penalty and was converted by the best player on view; Yedlin jabbed an elbow into Olivier Giroud's face on his way to creating Newcastle's equaliser, so his later misfortune was hardly a cause for violins. Benitez will argue that his team were level with Chelsea in the 88th minute, 120 seconds plus injury time from a draw with an elite opponent that hopes to contend the title.\\xa0 Had it been level at the end, Nerwcastle would have been praised for their resilience, particularly given a makeshift defence missing Jamaal Lascelles and with playmaker Jonjo Shelvey absent from midfield. In those circumstances, Benitez would have insisted the end justified the means, so perhaps it is just as well that Newcastle took nothing from this match. This love for the underdog cannot be unconditional.\\xa0 On first viewing I thought Fabian Schar’s challenge on Marcos Alonso was a penalty but, after watching a replay, the Newcastle defender does get a touch on the ball. Does this mean the referee got it wrong? No, there is a difference between getting a touch and dispossessing a player. Schar used a scissor motion to make the tackle and it was his second leg which was guilty of the foul. So yes, I support the decision of Paul Tierney, although I understand why it has divided opinion. Even the use of VAR would not have been definitive, the incident would still have been debated. As for Newcastle’s goal, it should not have stood. DeAndre Yedlin clearly struck the face of Olivier Giroud with his arm and, for me, did so deliberately. It should have been spotted and a foul awarded before the cross was made for Joselu to score.\\xa0 My Verdict by Mark Clattenburg\\xa0 Bravery and ambition must be part of that narrative, too, and it is hard to argue Newcastle showed either, given the limitations of their play. Few neutrals will have pitied them when the cards finally fell Chelsea's way. Some think Tierney did Chelsea a favour with the penalty but he certainly didn't do them too many over the other 89 minutes. Some of the treatment meted out to Hazard reminded of a Monday night against Stoke, under Jose Mourinho, when he was lucky not to be kicked out of the game entirely.\\xa0 He needed two lengthy periods of treatment to make it through the first-half here, but a Newcastle player was not booked for fouling him until the 65th minute. Fabian Schar was the culprit and maybe that event was still on Tierney's mind when he sent Marcos Alonso tumbling in the area less than ten minutes later.\\xa0 Maybe, too, Tierney had at last realised that Newcastle had been taking advantage of his leniency all game, and had been systematically targeting Hazard and others. They thought Chelsea could be roughed up, slapped back to London. They were proven wrong. In his challenge with Alonso, Schar got some of the ball, the top mostly, but not the meat of it. His follow through, however, became a scissor challenge that left Alonso sprawling, a reckless attempt in the penalty area. Unjust? Unjust is what had preceded it; 74 minutes that nearly removed Hazard from the game. It was fitting, then, that he was the one to put his shot past goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to give Chelsea a deserved lead. Now, had the next goal ended up affecting the outcome, that would have been a travesty. Not only was it against the run of play, but the build up included a blatant foul that could have caused serious injury. Newcastle had broken down the right, the ball was loose and, challenging for it, Yedlin gained an advantage over Giroud by shoving an elbow into his face.\\xa0 It did not appear accidental either, not one of those acts that is the product of a robust battle for supremacy. Yedlin looked like he deliberately repelled his opponent with a jab and Giroud fell to the ground, leaving him clear. Even so, credit where it is due, his cross was outstanding and the finish perfect. Yedlin whipped in the ball, perfect height, perfect position, and it was met by substitute Joselu at the near post. Newcastle, having played with scant ambition all game, were level.\\xa0 That is where it would have ended, had the home team not retreated to a default position, conceding territory and possession and ending up defending a Willian free-kick taken from midway in their half. The ball was played back across goal where Alonso – the best attacking defender in the Premier League statistically – hit a lot shot that startled Yedlin near the far post. He stuck out a boot and diverted it into his own goal. In one respect it was tough on Newcastle because with Lascelles mysteriously absent – the official club line was injury, the grapevine suggested conflict with the manager – this was a largely scratch defence, with two of the three central placements on debut, and left-footer, Schar, on the right.\\xa0 It is testament to the coaching skills of Benitez that they resisted Chelsea, with so little respite, for so long. Equally, for all Chelsea's pressure, Newcastle's lone chance of the first-half was probably the best of the game. It came in the 34th minute, a cross from Federico Fernandez met by Salomon Rondon, who was unable to get it on target despite being given the space for a free header. Yet this was an exceptional event, a rare moment when Newcastle revealed the potential to inflict lawful damage on Chelsea. Little of the rest was pretty and no amount of David v Goliath bluster or hard luck tales will justify it. Teams considerably poorer than Newcastle will try to give Chelsea more of a game this season, and some may even succeed. That's a good thing. Football shouldn't just be about beautiful football, aesthetics and artistry; but it still needs the good guys to win more often than not.\" => 0\n",

      "'Xbox One, PC - $59.99 / £39.99 Throughout the history of entertainment, the idea of manipulating time has always captivated audiences. Movies like Back to the Future and The Terminator, TV shows like Doctor Who and Quantum Leap and video games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Prince of Persia and Braid all popularised the idea and established it as one of the most interesting and dynamic concepts around. In Quantum Break, developers Remedy Entertainment sought to break boundaries and create a unique transmedia story that is at once both video game and live-action TV show, with an A-list cast of actors to back it up. Players take control of time-manipulating protagonist Jack Joyce – played by X-Men regular Shawn Ashmore – and find themselves at war with an evil corporation, Monarch.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0 It is led by Martin Hatch (Lance Reddick – The Wire, Fringe) and Paul Serene (Aidan Gillen – Game of Thrones, The Wire) who are desperately trying to cover up and contain the aftermath of a botched time travel experiment. Quantum Break takes place across five acts, with 20+ minute adrenaline-fuelled live-action episodes between each that – whilst being totally optional – drive the narrative forward, give insight into the motivations of each character (and humanize them in the process) and give players a unique cross-media experience. Jack has a number of time-bending powers at his disposal including the ability to slow down time, freeze time in a specific area, generate a Time Shield to deflect incoming bullets and dodge out of harm’s way with a Time Dodge and this is where Quantum Break shines. Having such a versatile set of abilities is tricky to begin with as cooldown timers are unforgiving and careless players can often find themselves in the middle of a bullet barrage, but once mastered the player is provided with an almost unlimited number of options during combat that can flow together and make short work of a room full of heavily armoured enemies. That being said, the rest of combat becomes dull very quickly. In spite of there being a good selection of weapons in the game that attempt to give some degree of variety to the combat, clunky player movement and weak shooting mechanics that lack the heavy punch of good gun sound effects cause the action segments of the game to become stale after the first few acts. Quantum Break also features a very awkward cover system that snaps Jack into cover whenever he is near an object, but unfortunately it takes some getting used to and feels dated compared to the myriad of current-gen third-person shooter’s that nail this mechanic. Plastered between the hectic combat and the live-action sections are awkward and uninspired platform sequences that force Jack to scale objects and use his time powers to solve very simple puzzles, however the clunky player movement causes these segments to become frustrating. In an attempt to offer players extra story details there are ‘narrative objects’ - Quantum Break’s take on collectibles – scattered throughout each act that come in the form of emails, audio files, intel etc. While these collectibles are designed to enhance the player’s experience (and sate the achievement hunters out there), what they actually do is encourage players to slow down and explore the levels, but as Jack’s movement speed is already so diabolically slow it ends up becoming more of an inconvenience, especially when some of the emails are painfully long to read and are often not interesting enough to justify tracking them down in the first place. Aesthetically Quantum Break is ambitious.\\xa0 The motion-capture is top notch and while it does use anti-aliasing and other visual effects for the time stutter elements very well, the game has a grainy overlay filter that’s reminiscent of TV shows like Battlestar Galactica that should have been toned down a notch or two. Despite Remedy going to great lengths to optimise performance – even going as far as locking the Xbox One version down to 720p/30fps - screen tearing and frame-rate drops were common, especially during the busier fight sequences and most of the time it did not feel like playing a current gen game. That being said the live-action segments do feature great performances from Ashmore, Reddick, Gillen and the plethora of other lesser-known actors and the production value is stellar, but the live-action sequences often felt like a relief from the stagnant gameplay – which was unlikely to be the intention. Quantum Break is a game of disappointing, disjointed parts. Whilst certainly ambitious, Remedy fail to bond the different elements into anything memorable. \\xa0 \\xa0' => 1\n",

      "'Showing off your knowledge might seem like a good idea when trying to impress a woman. But men deemed too clever are actually more likely to be turned down by the opposite sex, research shows. While women want some intelligence in a man, it seems that you can have too much of a good thing when it comes to brains. And chaps who are too physically attractive will not win plaudits with potential partners either. A study by researchers at the University of Western Australia found that women did not want exceptionally clever or handsome men. But the same did not hold true for men – who are not put off by extreme levels of intelligence or good looks, they found. Researchers asked hundreds of people what they found attractive in a potential romantic partner. Participants rated four qualities – good looks, cleverness, kindness and being easy-going. They were asked to say how attracted they would be to potential partners who were, for example, kinder than 1 per cent of the population. They were then asked the same for 10 per cent, 25 per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent, 90 per cent and 99 per cent of the population. For each percentage, participants rated the partners on a six-point scale from ‘extremely unattracted’ to ‘extremely attracted’. The results showed that the more the quality was present, the more attractive the person was as a partner – most of the time. But for females, partners lost their appeal at the top of the scale for some traits. Women said a partner would be more attractive if they were more intelligent than 90 per cent of the population. However, attractiveness decreased if the person was more intelligent than 99 per cent of the population. The same drop-off was seen for physical attractiveness and being easy-going, according to the findings published in the British Journal of Psychology. Co-author Dr Gilles Gignac said: ‘It is well established that several mate characteristics are valued highly in a prospective partner. ‘But the sort of continuous measurement used in our research is making it clear that several of these characteristics are associated with a threshold effect – in other words, you can have too much of a good thing.’' => 1\n",

      "\"Scientists have envisioned a nightmare scenario that could arise if a set of atypical gravitational waves were to slam into each other. Unlike traditional gravitational waves, which ripple outward along a spherical path, so-called plane-fronted gravitational waves surge forward as the result of objects moving at the speed of light. New simulations of collisions between these flat waves shows that such an event could have devastating effects across the cosmos, causing disturbances in space-time and spurring the birth of a black hole that would ultimately destroy Earth. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Researchers from Princeton University and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics detailed the new simulations in a new paper. It’s a scenario that isn’t likely to happen in reality, though some feared such a black hole would be created when the Large Hadron Collider was turned on, according to NewScientist. If two large enough plane-fronted waves were to collide, the researchers say the resulting black hole would gobble up almost all of the original energy. The 15 percent left over would mostly be cast off as weaker gravitational waves, and a smaller amount still would be stuck circling the black hole, according to NewScientist. For anything nearby, the event would spell disaster. ‘These particles have a lot of energy and produce curvature in space-time, and when the waves collide, that curvature wraps in on itself,’ Frans Pretorius at Princeton University told NewScientist. ‘Space-time is sort of sucking itself into a black hole.’ Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1916. Objects in the universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced, for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. Scientists first detected the shudders in space-time in 2016 and the discovery was hailed the 'biggest scientific breakthrough of the century'. Experts say gravitational waves open a 'new door' for observing the universe and gaining knowledge about enigmatic objects like black holes and neutron stars.  Luckily, experts say there’s no known object large enough to cause this type of phenomenon. Black holes are known for their destructive nature, gobbling up everything in their vicinity. It’s also thought that they may be surrounded by a ‘ring of fire’ that incinerates anything in their path. A separate study published earlier this summer, however, suggests the reality may be far more complex than the firewall theory accounted for. Researchers say they may instead act more like balls of string that accumulate more and more ‘fuzz’ as objects are pulled in. This means the fuzzy surface would extend to meet the object well before it reaches the hottest part of the black hole. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"British scientists have claimed that the first life on Earth evolved after a small planet called Theia collided with Earth. It 'sterilised' our planet and then went on to form the moon when it rebounded. A side-effect of this galactic collision was the first life on Earth, and scientists have now discovered that it happened 100 million years earlier than previously thought.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Researchers worked back through the evolutionary history of current animals to find the 'Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). They found that this animal is the ancestor of every living thing on Earth and likely existed around 3.9 billion years ago, when the Earth was still in its primitive stages.\\xa0\\xa0 PhD candidate in palaeontology Holly Betts at the University of Bristol explains more about the research in an article for\\xa0The Conversation.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Science may have enabled us to travel in space and trace the history of the entire universe, but it has not yet been able to answer exactly how and when life first arose on our planet.\\xa0 Traditionally, scientists have used the fossil record to try to answer these questions.\\xa0 Yet, as palaeontologists are all too aware, fossils are increasingly hard to find as we move backwards in time. In fact, we don't have a lot of rock available to study that is older than two and a half billion years.\\xa0 This is due to the Earth's rock recycling system in which old rocks are destroyed through weathering processes, with the remains getting recycled into new rocks.\\xa0 This causes any rocks that we do have to be highly reworked from their original composition.\\xa0 Often they don't contain any biological remains at all.\\xa0 Even the rare fossils that we do find are often very difficult to identify and cannot be easily linked to any specific group of modern organisms. In our new study, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, we decided to try and approach the construction of a timescale for life in a new way.\\xa0 This involved using the wealth of genetic data that we now have for organisms living today and applying a molecular clock, a method to decipher the past by reading the stories written in the genes of living organisms. All life inherits genetic information from the previous generation, and this gradually changes over time as evolutionary events take place.\\xa0 About 4.45 billion years ago, 150 million years after the solar system formed, Earth was hit by a Mars-size object called Theia. The collision created the moon, but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and Earth are so similar in their composition. The impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon.  This cloud would have been composed of some Earth material, explaining the similarity between Earth and the moon, and other material. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact.  The methodology works on the basis that the differences in the genomes of two extant (living) species, for example a human and a bacterium, have accumulated in a manner that is roughly proportional to the time since they had a common ancestor.\\xa0 Fossils still play a vital role in this approach by acting as a rough guide to the age of common ancestors, and the molecular clock is used to update these estimates. Our study combines the molecular data of 29 genes from a total of 102 living organisms (we also used nine fossils for calibration). The living organisms come from right across the tree of life – including bacteria, archaea (single-celled microorganisms) and eukaryotes (multi-celled organisms such as plants and animals). Including fossils in the process is vital to the analysis because they help to link the events in real time. Fossils tell us that a lineage must have existed prior to the age of the fossil, simply because the fossil is there.\\xa0 This method is most important for the reconstruction of life at its earliest points, because we have so little fossil material to work with.\\xa0 However, until now, this is precisely where it has been applied the least. Our results – a timescale for the origin and evolution of life – do come with fairly large uncertainties on the age estimates for each of the nodes, the places on the tree where species have a common ancestor.\\xa0 This is especially true for the most ancient parts of the tree and those parts where we have the least data, either fossil or molecular. However, the fact that we capture uncertainty is promising, as it indicates that our timescale is not over confident by showing precise, but false, ages. Instead it means that as new extant lineages and fossils continue to be discovered, they can be added to the analysis to both refine and update it – possibly resulting in a higher degree of precision in the future. We find that the 'last universal common ancestor' – a hypothetical very early single cell from which all life on Earth descended – existed prior to the 'late heavy bombardment'.\\xa0 This was a period of intense meteor bombardment sustained by our planet about 3.9 billion years ago. This is significantly earlier than the currently accepted oldest fossil evidence would suggest (estimating 3.5-3.8 billion years ago). The oldest confirmed fossils are from about 3.4 billion years ago, while the oldest potential fossils have been found on Greenland and date back to about 3.8 billion years ago.\\xa0 There's also a suggestion that carbon found in a 4.1 billion-year-old mineral called zircon could be biological in nature. However, scientists have so far been unable to confirm that. Some researchers think it would have been impossible for life to survive the late heavy bombardment, so that our oldest ancestor must be from after this phase.\\xa0 There are claims that the event would have sterilised the plants and vaporised any water around at the time.\\xa0 However, there are some recent mathematical models which suggest that pockets suitable for life could have remained. We found that the crown groups of the two main lineages of life – bacteria and archaea – appeared almost one billion years after the last common universal ancestor.\\xa0 Eukaryotes, on the other hand, diverged relatively late in Earth's history, about 1.8 billion years ago. This finding is consistent with previous studies. Our timescale also allowed us to look at ancient events such as the 'mitochondrial endosymbiosis' – the process which formed the mitochondria, the organelles that power our cellular respiratory systems.\\xa0 This important event in the history of the eukaryotes occurred close to when they first appeared, suggesting that it helped to drive their subsequent rapid spread. We hope that our study will be a good starting point for probing the mysteries of evolution at this extremely early time in Earth's history.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

The researchers also only used purified water to keep out any external tastes. Panellists also breathed through a moistened warm, clean cloth between tastings to keep their nasal passages clear as to not obstruct the low scents and aromas from the hot beverage. They marked each cup, like wine tasting, according to industry-wide descriptions such as nutty, smoky, floral, musty and others that help rate the quality of what they are drinking. According to their research, published in the specialist journal Food Research International, the best temperature overall was 70°C (158°F), particularly for those who like their coffee strong. Robusta beans, which are higher in caffeine, were significantly more intense and better tasting at this temperature than 60°C (140°F) or 50°C (122°F).\\xa0 An assistant chemistry professor of chemistry from the University of Oregon called Dr Christopher Hendon used science to find out how to make the perfect cup of coffee every time.\\xa0 Known as 'Dr Coffee' in certain social circles, the caffeine-loving scholar looked at how certain things can affect the taste of coffee.\\xa0 He found that hardness of water is related to better taste, the harder the water the stronger the taste.

Fresh beans stored in the fridge came out on top here because freshly roasted coffee contains carbon dioxide that easily evaporates.\\xa0 As this evaporates, so does most of the flavour.\\xa0 The type of grinder used is also important, as if the beans are ground up too finely they can clump together, detracting from the flavour.\\xa0 A powder is desirable as it increases surface area, which in theory creates more flavour.\\xa0 This is a fine balance however, as ground too fine the coffee will become clumpy - detracting from the overall experience.\\xa0 The final key to a good cup of coffee is the way the hot water mixes with the coffee. This process should be consistent and steady for maximum taste.\\xa0\\xa0 Arabica beans, used in most coffee chains, were better at 70°\\xa0(158°F) but the difference was less profound. Researchers say that tastes vary but that their tests were based on scientific evaluations of intensity rather than personal preferences. 'The coffee samples consumed at 70°C (158°F) had higher intensities for most of the key coffee attributes', researchers wrote. 'Research has suggested that the ideal serving temperature is 50°C (122°F) to nearly 80°C (176°F) to have optimal flavor notes.\\xa0 Previous research has found the optimal flavor notes are achieved if coffee temperature is maintained between 82.2°C (179.96°F)and 85°C (185°F) . 'However, our findings suggest that these differences may be dependent on the coffee, which may be why the range of suggested temperatures is so broad. 'In addition, previous findings have measured coffee using consumer acceptance, which varies because of consumer demographic segments.'\\xa0 Scientists found that drinking coffee any hotter than the recommended 70°C (158°F) is not recommended because there is a higher chance of scalding burn injuries.\\xa0 'Maintaining the temperature over testing by providing insulated containers, warming trays, and additional samples as needed is essential because this study shows that changes in temperature affect sensory properties', the researchers wrote. Caffeine has been deemed safe for consumption in doses of up to 400 mg per day for the general population.\\xa0 Studies suggest it can have a variety of health benefits, including combating liver disease and type two diabetes. Research has even suggested it could even help people live longer. It is the world's most widely consumed stimulant and reports show it can boost daily energy expenditure by around five per cent. Researchers have said combining two to four daily coffees with regular exercise would be even more effective at keeping the weight off. A 2015 study showed just a couple of cups a day could help millions of dieters stay trim once they have achieved their desired weight.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"Danny Care freely admits that it was embarrassing. Harlequins, one of the marquee institutions in English rugby, collapsed in a heap late last season. It was as if they stopped trying — or caring. For an iconic name in the sport, this was a period of repeated indignities. The London club lost their last five games of the Premiership season and they weren't just beaten, they were routed. London Irish completed the double over their old rivals by putting 35 points on them at The Stoop, shortly before being relegated. Worcester filled their boots against the abject Quins, scoring 44 at Sixways. In all, those five fixtures saw 181 points conceded and a paltry 55 registered in response. Just six years after claiming the league title, a team awash with England players finished 10th in the table, on the same points tally as Worcester in 11th.\\xa0 The demise led to a brutal and comprehensive overhaul of the coaching staff and now — with ex-England defence coach Paul Gustard in charge — Care is optimistic that the darkest hour will precede a new dawn. 'Last year, we all know how embarrassing it was by the end of it,' said the England scrum-half.\\xa0 'It definitely hurt. It's my 13th year at the club, I love the club and to be down where we were and losing games like that — it's something I've never really experienced before, we were embarrassed and it was hard to put your finger on what it was.\\xa0 'The club has made the decision to bring in new voices and go in a new direction and I do feel that it was needed. 'The coaches who were here before had done a brilliant job but we've got the right people in place now and we're going in the right direction. It's a new era with new ideas and a new identity. As players, we've got to take a lot of responsibility — we owe the club some good performances.' Care struggled to identify the precise cause of Harlequins' demise last season, but sensed that they were a side on the slide. 'We just let a few standards slip in training and it definitely showed in games. We were just too inconsistent throughout the season. We would play well in a big game then be pretty poor for the next two or three. We started the season pretty well and Christmas time we were in it, but from January onwards it went downhill.' Gustard stepped down from his post as Eddie Jones' defensive guru with England in order to take on the task of reviving Quins. He will bring a ferocious intensity, work ethic and an innovative streak to the task of turning around this bastion of the domestic rugby establishment.\\xa0 The club have a solid fan-base, a decent ground, relative financial stability and box-office assets in their squad — but they need a revitalised team to complete a picture of prosperity. As an enthusiastic Liverpool football fan, Care can see in Gustard hallmarks of Jurgen Klopp, the German who has restored title ambitions at Anfield.\\xa0 'He reminds me of a bit of a Klopp-type manager, a guy who makes you work incredibly hard but a guy who will also put an arm round you if you need that,' said the 31-year-old. 'From day one, since I met Guzzie, I've loved working with him. He's a mate as well, so he's going to be honest this year in driving standards and he'll want us older boys to help with that. All he wants to do is win — he hates losing. We're quite similar in that respect. He's got a tough edge, which I love about him.' The Quins-Liverpool FC comparison extended to acknowledging that Gustard must oversee the development of a more resilient defence, as Klopp has done with his team. Care identified the secret to Liverpool's strides in that area — the £75million world-record signing of Virgil van Dijk. 'Big Virgil will sort you out,' he joked. So who is Quins' own Virgil? 'I'd say Robbo (Chris Robshaw) — as a leader, as a defensive leader, as a voice,' he added. 'He controls the defence and he sees the game more clearly than other people. I'd put him as our Virgil.' Harlequins certainly need those qualities in abundance, if there truly is to be a revival. After shipping a half-century of points against Glasgow in a recent pre-season fixture, it remains to be seen whether the new dawn is still some way off.\" => 0\n",

      "\"Peter Hartley had the last laugh over Rangers as the Motherwell skipper's 94th-minute equaliser sealed a 3-3 draw at Fir Park. The defender had been forced to issue an apology on Thursday after mocking former Gers defender Fabio Cardoso and the broken nose he suffered in a tussle with Well frontman Ryan Bowman last term. But it was Hartley who grabbed the injury-time equaliser as the Light Blues threw away victory for the second time in three Ladbrokes Premiership games.

It looked like Ovie Ejaria's goal just before the break would send Rangers on their 4,600-mile Europa League round trip to Ufa on Thursday in confident mood - only for Hartley to pounce with the last kick of the game. With next week's Old Firm battle in mind, Gerrard took the chance to road-test a 3-5-2 formation as Jon Flanagan joined Connor Goldson and Nikola Katic in a new-look three-man back line. As well as Lafferty's reintroduction to the starting XI, Borna Barisic and Andy Halliday also came back in while the hosts made changes to as Allan Campbell and Chris Cadden were welcomed back by Stephen Robinson. The Gers defence has functioned so well this term that they had not spent a single second behind all season but it took just three minutes for that to change as Johnson struck. Cadden's ball over the top looked destined for Goldson's head only for the defender to slip on the greasy surface at the vital moment. To make matters worse, Allan McGregor's footing also went from underneath him and forward Johnson took advantage as he lobbed the ball over the stranded goalkeeper into an empty net. That teed up a breathless start with chances aplenty at either end but it was Rangers who levelled on 16 minutes as Lafferty struck. Hartley could only clear a Barisic cross to the edge of the box, where the Northern Irish striker was lurking to slam past his compatriot Trevor Carson with the aid of a big deflection off Richard Tait. Yet Rangers were behind again within minutes as Katic failed to track McHugh as Gael Bigirimana lined-up a free-kick from deep, leaving the Irishman to loop a header over McGregor. But the hosts were also guilty of switching off in defence and paid the price when Rangers hit back again on 38 minutes. Tom Aldred did not spot Lafferty cutting across him as James Tavernier collected a quick throw and was powerless to stop the big frontman nodding home. Rangers were ahead two minutes before half-time as they broke with lightning speed from a Well corner. Alfredo Morelos, Ryan Jack and Barisic all combined as the visitors flooded forward but Carson should have done much better than allow Ejaria's strike to dribble into the net. If the first period had been action-packed, the second was a quieter affair but no less compelling. Motherwell piled forward in the final stages looking for an equaliser. Hartley and Curtis Main both came close as they cranked up the pressure. Gerrard threw on Lee Wallace for the final corner of the game but the former Rangers skipper could not stop Hartley ramming home from Bigirimana's delivery.\" => 0\n",

      "\"One of the rarest birds in the world has been re-discovered in the Bahamas more than two years after the species was thought to have died out worldwide. The elusive bird, known as the\\xa0Bahama nuthatch, was thought to have been wiped from existence following Hurricane Matthew back in 2016. The storm devastated the archipelago with gusts of wind of hitting speeds of 120mph. Ornithologists believed the destruction caused by the storm wiped out the remaining population of the critically-endangered bird. However, the rare animal has been spotted again after two years of obscurity.\\xa0 The sighting has been compared to finding a 'needle in a haystack', however experts are concerned it may still not be possible to bring the Bahama nuthatch back from the brink of extinction because there are too few animals still alive. Scroll down for video\\xa0\\xa0 Experts have delighted at the sighting of the rare bird, but it is feared there could only be two left – making it one of the world's most critically endangered animals. The Bahama Nuthatch is only known to exist in a small area of native pine forest on Grand Bahama Island, which lies approximately 100 miles (160 km) off Palm Beach, Florida.\\xa0 There has been an unprecedented population decline in recent years, with numbers plummeting from around 1,800 in 2004 to just 23 birds in 2007. The problem is believed to have started in the 1950s as a result of habitat loss due to deforestation on Grand Bahama Island. It was feared Hurricane Matthew was the final straw for a species already teetering on the brink of annihilation. However, a new example of the bird species has been found and shot on film as part of an extensive search by two masters students from the University of East Anglia, who trawled the islands as part of a three month search. Matthew Gardner and David Pierra undertook what is believed to be one of the most extensive searches for the species ever undertaken. Dr Diana Bell, from UEA's School of Biological Sciences, said: 'The Bahama Nuthatch is a critically endangered species, threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, invasive species, tourist developments, fires and hurricane damage. 'Our researchers looked for the bird across 464 survey points in 34,000 hectares of pine forest.\\xa0It must have been like looking for a needle in a hay stack. 'They played out a recording of the bird's distinctive call in order to attract it.'\\xa0 In spite of the miraculous discovery, Dr Bell is concerned the likelihood of bringing the species back from the brink remains 'slim'. This is because of the very low numbers left alive, and because scientists are not entirely sure of the precise drivers for its decline. The Bahama Nuthatch has a long bill, distinctive high-pitched squeaky call, and nests only in mature pine trees. In order to track down the bird, the pair traipsed through thick vegetation known as 'poisonwood' – a thick layer of foliage that grows beneath the main forest canopy.

A similar search was being conducted on the opposite side of the island by\\xa0Bahamian students, led by Zeko McKenzie of Loma Linda University. The UEA team made six sighting and the Loma Linda expedition contributed an additional five. Both groups used different methods and the Bahamas-natives were fortunate enough to glimpse what appeared to be two of the birds together.\\xa0 Mr Gardner said: 'We had been scouring the forest for about six weeks, and had almost lost hope. At that point we'd walked about 248 miles (400km). 'Then, I suddenly heard its distinctive call and saw the unmistakable shape of a nuthatch descending towards me. I shouted with joy, I was ecstatic. 'During three months of intensive searching we made six Bahama nuthatch sightings.\\xa0Our search was extremely thorough but we never saw two birds together, so we had thought there might only be one left in existence.\\xa0 'The other team have claimed to see two together so that is promising. However, these findings place the species on the verge of extinction and certainly amongst the world's most critically endangered birds. 'We also don't know the sex of the birds. In many cases when birds dwindle to such small numbers, any remaining birds are usually male.' Both teams made their sightings in May and\\xa0Michael Parr, president of American Bird Conservancy and a UEA alumnus, claims the proof is incontrovertible due to the unique markings on the bird. Mr McKenzie said: 'Although the Bahama nuthatch has declined precipitously, we are encouraged by the engagement of conservation scientists who are now looking for ways to save and recover the species.'\\xa0\\xa0 Hurricane Matthew was the first Category 5 Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Felix in 2007. It caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in Haiti, as well as widespread devastation in the southeastern United States.\\xa0 It caused extensive damage to landmasses in the Greater Antilles, and severe damage in several islands of the Bahamas who were still recovering from Hurricane Joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier.\\xa0 At one point, the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of Category 3 or higher intensity to strike the United States since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, but Matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the Floridian coastline.\\xa0 It caused mass devastation to Haiti and other islands in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

Initial research suggested the lights, which have come to be known as STEVE, may be a type of aurora, though slightly different than the ones we’re used to. A new study, however, has determined that this is not the case; according to the researchers, STEVE is the result of different atmospheric processes, making it an entirely distinct phenomenon. Scroll down for video\\xa0 STEVE was initially given its name in honor of the 2006 film Over the Hedge, and the title was later accepted in the scientific community as a ‘backronym,’ standing for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. This type of light event appears closer to the equator than a normal aurora. In the latest study, researchers analyzed a STEVE event that occurred over eastern Canada on March 28, 2008. The team compared images from ground-based cameras with data from the NOAA’s Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite 17 (POES-17), which was overhead at the time and can measure charged particles raining down towards Earth. Unlike a traditional aurora, which is produced as electrons and protons pour into the ionosphere, the researchers found there were no charged particles associated with the STEVE event. This suggests it wasn’t an aurora at all. ‘Our main conclusion is that Steve is not an aurora,’ says Bea Gallardo-Lacourt, a space physicist at the University of Calgary in Canada and lead author of the new study in Geophysical Research Letters. ‘So right now, we know very little about it. And that’s the cool thing, because this has been known by photographers for decades. The Northern and Southern Lights are natural light spectacles triggered in our atmosphere that are also known as the 'Auroras'. There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means 'dawn of the north', and Aurora Australis, 'dawn of the south.' The displays light up when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere.\\xa0 Usually the particles, sometimes referred to as a solar storm, are deflected by Earth’s magnetic field. But during stronger storms they enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles, including hydrogen and helium. These collisions emit light. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are common. ‘But for the scientists, it’s completely unknown.’ Instead of being an aurora, the researchers say the STEVE events can be classified as a type of ‘skyglow.’ But, they still aren’t quite sure what’s causing them. Researchers are now working to determine whether the lights are the result of particles in the ionosphere, or if they’re coming from a region higher up in the atmosphere. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "'Ride-hailing services might seem like a money-saving alternative to buying a car for people who live in urban areas. But according to a new study, it’s not nearly as cost-effective as you’d think.\\xa0 The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that using ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber as a primary mode of transportation works out to be far more expensive than owning a car – even with fuel, insurance, parking, and the vehicle itself considered. According to the new AAA study, relying on ride-hailing services could cost a person roughly $20,118 per year. The study focuses on urban settings, which are the only practical environments where personal cars could be replaced with ride-hailing, AAA notes. In urban areas, the average driver puts 10,841 miles on their car per year. Even in cities with lower annual ride-hailing costs, such as Dallas, TX ($16,944), the expense is still much greater than the costs associated with car ownership. An earlier study by AAA found that the average new car costs a driver $8,469 annually, or $706 per month based on 15,000 miles driven. For 10,841 miles of travel annually, the firm estimates the cost to be around $7,321. ‘Whether you own a vehicle or not, ride-hailing services are a convenient transportation option,’ said John Nielsen, managing director, Automotive Engineering and Repair. ‘However, with the average American city-dweller driving nearly 11,000 miles per year, a personal vehicle is still the more cost-effective choice.’ In some major urban areas, the estimated annual costs for people who rely on ride-hailing services are staggering. In New York, AAA estimates people pay about $21,279 per year – and in Boston, this number is upwards of $27,000. Parking is one area that can be a killer when it comes to cost; according to the AAA estimates, this costs anywhere from $706 (Phoenix) to $8,088 (New York) per year. But, even with this expense considered, using ride-hailing services was found to be the more costly option. For those lucky enough to have access to free parking, the use of ride-hailing services works out to be almost three times as expensive as vehicle ownership. ‘For those who travel a very limited number of miles annually, or have mobility issues that prevent them from driving a personal vehicle, ride-hailing can be a viable and important option,’ Nielsen said. ‘But, for everyone else: the car is still king.’' => 1\n",

      "\"Researchers have simulated nearly 500,000 years of California earthquakes in effort to better forecast potential hazards across the state. Large earthquakes pose extreme risks to populated areas, but their activity can be unpredictable; such events tend to be few and far between, and modelling them often relies on uncertain assumptions. A new physics-based model could finally allow for more precise forecasts, using supercomputer simulations to cut out the assumptions and confirm estimates for specific regions. Scroll down for video\\xa0 ‘Whether a big earthquake happens next week or 10 years from now, engineers need to build for the long run,’ said lead author Bruce Shaw, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ‘We now have a physical model that tells us what the long-term hazards are.’ The new simulator, dubbed RSQSim, uses rate and state-dependent friction to estimate how stress transfers between faults based on real-world ruptures. These events can sometimes trigger bigger quakes. The researchers simulated nearly 500,000 years of earthquakes, and found they were able to match the hazard estimates from the current leading statistical model. ‘This shows our simulator is ready for prime time,’ Shaw said. The new simulator can be used to test current predictions for specific regions, to make more accurate hazard estimations. Such estimates are critical for construction and building regulations in high-risk areas. But, RSQSim isn’t perfect yet. The researchers say adding more factors into the calculations and more computing power will further improve the model. ‘Details such as earthquakes in unexpected places, the evolution of earthquake faults over geological time, and the viscous flow deep under the tectonic plates are not yet built in,’ says John Vidale, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center. The magnitude of an earthquake differs from its intensity. The magnitude of an earthquake refers to the measurement of energy released where the earthquake originated. Magnitude is calculated based on measurements on seismographs. The intensity of an earthquake refers to how strong the shaking that is produced by the sensation is. According to the United States Geological Survey, 'intensity is determined from the effects on people, human structures and the natural environment'. Earthquakes originate below the surface of the earth in a region called the hypocenter.\\xa0 During an earthquake, one part of a seismograph remains stationary and one part moves with the earth's surface. The earthquake is then measured by the difference in the positions of the still and moving parts of the seismograph.\\xa0 As the model improves, the researchers plan to use it to better understand aftershocks, and plan to incorporate it into a ground-motion model called CyberShake. All of these efforts could eventually lead to better predictions. ‘As we improve the physics in our simulations and computers become more powerful, we will better understand where and when the really destructive earthquakes are likely to strike,’ says study coauthor Kevin Milner, a researcher at USC.\" => 1\n",

With nothing more than a wingsuit, Alberto Tagliati successfully pulled off the death-defying stunt earlier this month.\\xa0 Wingsuits, sometimes referred to as 'birdman suits', creates a surface area of fabric between the legs and under the arms that allows the wearer to fly. The 45-year-old software developer from Milan, Italy said that he had to be 'extremely focused' for the jump from the mountain's north wall.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr Tagliat said: 'I couldn't contain my excitement after looking down at the impressive view below me.

The Eiger is a 13,015 foot (3,067-metre) tall mountain in the Bernese Alps, overlooking Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland. Eiger was first successfully scaled by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren (de) and Irishman Charles Barrington in 1938.\\xa0 The first ascent of the Eiger was made by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren (de) and Irishman Charles Barrington, who completed the climb up the west flank on August 11, 1858.\\xa0 The north face is widely regarded as one of the hardest and most dangerous climbs in the world.\\xa0 It was not conquered until 1938, when an Austrian-German expedition successfully scaled it.\\xa0 A wingsuit is a one-piece garment that covers the entire body from the neck down and is worn by adrenaline-junkies and daredevils alike. It is used in extreme sports such as jumping from an airplane and even, in some cases, base jumping.\\xa0 Base jumping is where a person jumps off a building, ledge or mountain and then releases a parachute to ensure a safe landing. It has sections of fabric between the arms and legs that inflate when the wearer jumps from an aircraft or a high place. This keeps the fabric taut and allows a person to glide through the air.\\xa0 The person is responsible for keeping their body in the right position to keep the fabric as tight as possible, with arms outstretched and legs parted - in a shape that resembles a a starfish.\\xa0 The suit is designed to make the wearer as aerodynamic as possible and allow them to spend longer in the air.\\xa0 It also allows the person to elongate the lateral distance travelled when jumping, as it increases the respective distance travelled along the ground relative to the distance dropped since launch.\\xa0 Inspiration for wingsuits can be seen throughout the animal kingdom, with flying squirrels and foxes having similar morphology.\\xa0 These use flaps of skin that stretched between outstretched appendages - normally arms or fingers.\\xa0 Since it was first conquered, the Eiger has become somewhat of a litmus test for climbing fanatics, and has received widespread notoriety for the series of tragic deaths on the mountain. Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname Mordwand, literally 'murder(ous) wall'—a pun on its correct title of Nordwand (North Wall) 'Once I am airborne all my thoughts are quiet and I am living in the moment,' Mr\\xa0Tagliat revealed. 'When I open my parachute all the adrenaline wears off and I enjoy the view while I fly my parachute to the landing.\\xa0 'After each and every successful landing, when I start thinking about what I just did, I often feel privileged. Flying has always been a dream of mankind and I feel very lucky to be able to experience it.'\\xa0\\xa0 World-famous wingsuit flier Dean Potter was killed in 2015 when he jumped from\\xa0a cliff in Yosemite National Park.

Under pressure, rushed and maybe even panicking a little, Laporte swung a foot wildly at the ball and was probably quite happy to see it fly over his own crossbar for a corner. If truth be told, the ball could have gone anywhere. Laporte was not bought for moments like that. He was bought — for £57million from Athletic Bilbao — for his rather more measured calm and his comfort on the ball. But when things get tight at the end of big Premier League games, sometimes anywhere will do and it was because of Wolves — their attitude, their courage and their belief — that City were involved in a game right until the very end at Molineux on Saturday. In truth, we thought we had seen the end of this. We thought only the really big teams were prepared to stand toe to toe with City in the Pep Guardiola age. Even some of them — Manchester United and Chelsea for example — are not that keen. Last season the norm was for opposing teams to sit deep in their own half and hope. Rafa Benitez's Newcastle did it memorably last winter and lost. Sam Allardyce's Everton did it at Goodison in the spring and lost. When it came to bravery, only teams such as Liverpool, Tottenham, Napoli in the Champions League and, strangely, Bristol City in the League Cup, were prepared to engage with Guardiola's players. A game of football had started to require a new definition when brilliant, untouchable City were in town. So thank you, Wolves, for this. Thank you for showing us that there is another way. Thank you for giving us a game in the traditional sense of the word.\\xa0 How strange that it has taken a team newly promoted from the Championship to remind us that Guardiola's City are human after all. Wolves, by the way, could easily have lost. Maybe they really should have lost. Had the Premier League not discarded the VAR system, the goal by which they took the lead in the second half would not have stood, given that it was handled into the goal by Willy Boly. City also hit post and bar three times, including with pretty much the last kick of the game by Sergio Aguero. So, yes, City were the better side and on another day might have won by a couple of goals. But that isn't really the point. The point is that teams who sit in their own half and strangle the game tend to lose anyway.\\xa0 Here, Wolves attempted to impose themselves on City and in doing so they seriously worried the champions at times, pressing them into mistakes in their own half, creating chances and raising the volume levels at Molineux to such an extent that Billy Wright's famous statue outside must have been shaking on its plinth at times. Afterwards, Guardiola was decent enough not to moan too much about the Wolves goal. VAR will be back soon and when it is, the Premier League will be a better place for the better teams.\\xa0 The City manager didn't want to be drawn too much on Wolves' approach either but conceded: 'I think the spectators  and people on TV will have enjoyed it because we had chances and they had chances and I think for the Premier League that is good.' Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo looked rather non-plussed when asked if his approach might have bucked the trend in the Premier League a little. 'It's an identity that we want to create,' he said. 'It doesn't matter who is in front us, we just go. Show no weakness.' Santo speaks like his team play — clearly, and with conviction. It will be interesting to see how they get on over the course of the season but Kompany suggested good teams will lose at Molineux. Mark Clattenburg on Willy Boly's goal\\xa0 You can argue Willy Boly's handball is not deliberate, but it never feels right that a player can use his arm or hand to score a goal, especially as he changed the direction of the ball and gained an advantage by doing so. It should have been a free-kick to Manchester City. It is difficult, however, to attach blame to referee Martin Atkinson. For starters, it looked like a perfectly good goal on first viewing. He also has several players blocking his view and must rely on his assistant to make the call. The assistant, in his defence, is also checking for offside and it looks like Matt Doherty does make slight contact with the ball. It is a tight decision as Benjamin Mendy's foot could still be playing Boly onside, so the benefit must go to the attacking team. But the key here is that a handball goal was missed and it is yet another example of the need for technology to assist the officiating team, because I think it was near enough impossible for them to see this in real time. 'Wolves don't play like a team who have just been promoted,' he said. 'I'm confident they will take points off our competitors. 'They are geared up to get big scalps because they have enough quality and key players work hard. That's always a good mix.' Whether Wolves can continue this way when a long season begins to take its toll, we do not know. That will depend on squad depth, as much as anything. Regarding City, that remains one of their great strengths. Even with Kevin De Bruyne injured and Phil Foden not involved, the City substitutes' bench is terrifying to look at. Yet in the Black Country, even the introduction of Leroy Sane, Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez wasn't enough and the neutrals and all those who love a contest will have been grateful for that. For City, it's Newcastle up next. The chances are that will be a little different.\" => 0\n",

      "\"A patch of frozen water off the north coast of Greenland once known as ‘the last ice area’ has begun to break apart for the first time on record. This area of the Arctic is home to the oldest and thickest ice in the region, which has until now withstood the effects of climate change. While the break-up of sea ice in this part of the Arctic has never been documented in the past, experts say it’s happened twice this year alone as a result of warm winds and hotter temperatures, according to The Guardian. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The waters off the north coast of Greenland are situated in some of the coldest parts of the Arctic, and it’s long been assumed that they would be among the last to experience the melting effects seen in other areas. After a period of unusual warmth this past February and at the beginning of August, however, it now appears that may not be the case, The Guardian reports. The drifting ice has now opened up the biggest gap from the coast ever recorded. ‘Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,’ Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute told The Guardian. On social media, other scientists have said the recent phenomenon is 'scary,' with one animation shared by researcher Leif Toudal showing how the ice has moved. It’s just the latest in a worrying trend as Arctic sea ice continues to dwindle as a result of the changing climate. Sea ice extent declined rapidly at the beginning of the summer, and while it isn’t expected to set a new record minimum this coming September, experts estimate it will still be among the lowest in 40 years of keeping track. ‘Through the first two weeks of August, ice extent declined at approximately 65,000 square kilometers (25,100 square miles) per day, slightly faster than the 1981 to 2010 average of 57,000 square kilometers (22,000 square miles) per day,’ according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center. The pace has finally begun to slow after weeks of above-average activity. The amount of Arctic sea ice peaks around March as winter comes to a close. NASA recently announced that the maximum amount of sea ice this year was low, following three other record-low measurements taken in 2015, 2016 and 2017. This can lead to a number of negative effects that impact climate, weather patterns, plant and animal life and indigenous human communities. Additionally, the disappearing ice can alter shipping routes and affect coastal erosion and ocean circulation. NASA researcher Claire Parkinson said: 'The Arctic sea ice cover continues to be in a decreasing trend and this is connected to the ongoing warming of the Arctic. 'It's a two-way street: the warming means less ice is going to form and more ice is going to melt, but, also, because there's less ice, less of the sun's incident solar radiation is reflected off, and this contributes to the warming.'\\xa0 Arctic sea ice extent sits at 5.7 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) as of August 15, according to NSIDC. This puts it lower than the average, but still above the record minimum, the experts explain. The current extent is ‘1.58 million square kilometers (610,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average, but 868,000 square kilometers (335,000 square miles) above the record low at this time of year recorded in 2012,’ according to NSIDC. The scientists say the 2018 minimum extent will likely sit between the fourth and ninth lowest on record. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"Scientists in recent years have predicted that Earth’s magnetic field could be gearing up to ‘flip’ – a shift in which the magnetic south pole would become magnetic north, and vice versa. Such an event could have catastrophic effects, wreaking havoc on the electric grid and leaving life at the surface exposed to higher amounts of solar radiation. While it’s previously been thought that these reversals take place at intervals of hundreds of thousands of years, a new study suggests it could happen in just a matter of centuries. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Scientists estimate Earth’s North and South magnetic poles flip every 200,000-300,000 years. But, it’s been roughly 780,000 years since the last such event, causing many to suspect we’re overdue. When the magnetic poles flip, Earth’s protective magnetic field weakens, leaving its inhabitants at higher risk from the effects of space weather. ‘Earth’s magnetic field, which has existed for at least 3.45 billion years, provides a shield from the direct impact of solar radiation,’ said Professor Roberts from the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences. ‘Even with Earth’s strong magnetic field today, we’re still susceptible to solar storms that can damage our electricity-based society.’ In the new study, researchers at the Australian National University analyzed the paleomagnetic record from 107,000 to 91,000 years ago by analyzing a stalagmite from a cave in southwestern China. The team conducted magnetic analysis and radiometric dating on the meter-long sample, revealing the behaviour of the ancient magnetic field. And, they found the magnetic field experienced a rapid shift over the span of about two centuries, decreasing in strength by about 90 percent when a field reversal occurred. The Earth’s magnetic field is in a permanent state of change.\\xa0 Magnetic north drifts around and every few hundred thousand years the polarity flips so a compass would point south instead of north.\\xa0 The strength of the magnetic field also constantly changes and currently it is showing signs of significant weakening.\\xa0 Life has existed on the Earth for billions of years, during which there have been many reversals.\\xa0 There is no obvious correlation between animal extinctions and those reversals. Likewise, reversal patterns do not have any correlation with human development and evolution.  It appears that some animals, such as whales and some birds use Earth's magnetic field for migration and direction finding.  Since geomagnetic reversal takes a number of thousands of years, they could well adapt to the changing magnetic environment or develop different methods of navigation. Radiation at ground level would increase, however, with some estimates suggesting that overall exposure to cosmic radiation would double causing more deaths from cancer. ‘But only slightly,’ said Professor Richard Holme.  ‘And much less than lying on the beach in Florida for a day. So if it happened, the protection method would probably be to wear a big floppy hat.’ The movement of the Earth's magnetic poles are shown in this animation at 10-year intervals from 1970 to 2020. The red and blue lines sjpw the difference between magnetic north and true north depending on where you are standing. On the green line, a compass would point to true north. Credit: NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information Electric grid collapse from severe solar storms is a major risk. As the magnetic field continues to weaken, scientists are highlighting the importance off-the grid energy systems using renewable energy sources to protect the Earth against a black out.\\xa0 'The very highly charged particles can have a deleterious effect on the satellites and astronauts,' added Dr Mona Kessel, a Magnetosphere discipline scientist at Nasa.  In one area, there is evidence that a flip is already occurring. ‘The increasing strength of the South Atlantic anomaly, an area of weak field over Brazil, is already a problem,’ said Professor Richard Holme.\\xa0  The Earth's climate could also change. A recent Danish study has found that the earth's weather has been significantly affected by the planet's magnetic field. They claimed that fluctuations in the number of cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere directly alter the amount of cloud covering the planet. Henrik Svensmark, a weather scientist at the Danish National Space Centre who led the team behind the research, believes that the planet is experiencing a natural period of low cloud cover due to fewer cosmic rays entering the atmosphere. The damage to power grids and communications systems resulting from such a flip in today’s society would cause trillions of dollars in damage, the researchers explain. ‘Hopefully such an event is a long way in the future and we can develop future technologies to avoid huge damage, where possible, from such events,’ Professor Roberts said. The study suggests Earth’s magnetic field is a lot more unpredictable than suspected, the researchers say. ‘The record provides important insights into ancient magnetic field behaviour,’ Professor Roberts said, ‘which has turned out to vary much more rapidly than previously thought.’\" => 1\n",

      "\"With the rise of cheap smart speakers, virtually disposable headphones and booming TV soundbars, its been a tough few years  for high quality audio. However, British brand Naim may have the answer. It's $2,999 Uniti Atom is a revelation, an integrated amplifier than makes it easy to stream music at a quality you've probably never heard before. Scroll down for video\\xa0 It fact, I'd go so far as to say it can help you rediscover the lost art of listening to music - and has without doubt given me more enjoyment in the few weeks I've been using it that any other piece of technology over the past few years. Everything about the Atom screams quality, from the industrial 'monolith' design with its metal fins to the screen that dominates the front of the unit. Looks wise, it owes more to Apple and Braun than the historic hi-fi designs that were dominated by buttons and dials. In fact, there are just four buttons - and you'll rarely use any of them.\\xa0 However, there is the mother of all dials - \\xa0a brilliantly designed volume control on the top of the unit. It lights up to show how loud the system is, and is  perfectly weighted, making it strangely addictive to use. For most functions, however, there's a choice of a slightly overly complicated remote, or a superb app. I found myself using the app 99% of the time, other than wanting to change the volume while watching TV.\\xa0  But while the specs and design are all well and good, the key to the Atom is the sound. It's simply jaw dropping. I regularly found myself up until 2am listening (sorry neighbours) remembering a favourite song and being unable to contain the urge to listen to it. The amount of detail and presence in the system is amazing - with the very best recordings, you really do get a sense of being in the studio, and can hear exactly where each instrument is.\\xa0 On tracks like The Streets' Blinded by the Lights the bass is precise and undistorted, while classic Beatles tracks (particularly the recently remastered albums) reveal new detail in music you've been listening to your whole life. The most interesting thing about the Atom is that it's so compelling, its almost impossible to have music on in the background. I found myself having to go sit down to repeat tracks constantly just to hear them from the optimum position, and its all encompassing - even reading at the same time is often impossible. I also used the Atom for my TV sound, and this worked very well - obviously you're not getting any kind of surround sound, but the sound you are getting is exceptionally clear and precise. If you're worried about the Uniti being loud enough, don't be - Naim claims 40 watts per channel into 8 ohms, which in reality means it'll be more than loud enough for pretty much anything other than the biggest speakers. Crucial to the Atom is the integration of streaming services, with Spotify and Tidal being being in. Spotify sounds great on the Atom, but to really get the most out of it, you'll need a Tidal Hi-Fi subscription for its lossless service. The combination of Tidal and the Atom is a revelation, and makes you realise just what most streaming services are lacking in terms of quality (although that said, on the average headphones or hifi setup you probably won't hear much of a difference).\\xa0 There's also Chromecast support, meaning there's a plethora of other apps available that can use the Atom, along with bluetooth support.\\xa0 Basically, you can hook up pretty much anything.\\xa0 It's also possible to use the Atom for TV sounds, which I did using the digital input on the back of the unit - but there's also an option to get a HDMI input.\\xa0 The attention to detail in getting the best sound is almost terrifying at times. Finding the perfect speaker to go with the Uniti can be tough - but we were able to try it out with the $999 Q Acoustic Concept 40s, and they're a perfect combination. The floorstanding speakers look amazing, with a white laquer finish that gives then a modern, but not too space age, feel. However, its the sound that is jaw dropping.\\xa0 Put simply, you've probably never heard music like this before. It's incredible precise, especially if you spend a little bit of time getting the speakers in the perfect position.\\xa0 The combination can seem a \\xa0little unforgiving at time, particularly with stereo effect - you really do need to be sat in the right place to get the best out of them. But sit in the sweet spot and it's truly mind blowing - and as with the Uniti, you'll see exactly why these speakers carry such a high price, and realise what you've been missing with any other setup.\\xa0 \\xa0 From a power supply with  floating pins aimed at ensuring a better connection to hand-wired analogue and digital circuitry, every element of the design in Uniti Atom has been considered for its effect on sound quality. The Atom also looks great, in a very industrial way. The screen is sharp and clear - although it really feels like it should be a touchscreen, and you'll without doubt reach out the first few times you use it.\\xa0 Overall, it's incredible difficult to fault the Atom.\\xa0 The app can be a little confusing at times, but with each update, it has improved. But overall, this really is the perfect combination of old school hi-fi know how and modern technology. It manages to bring the slightly archaic and ultra nerdy world of high end hifi into the world of streaming without compromising quality.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \" => 1\n",

      "\"Spending $1,000 on a wireless speaker at first sounds absurd. But think back to an era where music really meant something, and wasn't just a commodity bundled free with your phone. Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back those days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. Scroll down for video Width: 8.6 in Depth: 8.3 in Height: 8.3 in Weight: 12.35 lbs\\xa0 Naim’s original, the Mu-so, marked a massive change for wireless, digital music. It sounded stunning, and boasted incredible volume and more importantly, clarity that no other all in one system could match. However, it was big, hefty, and cost an eye watering $1499. Now, Naim has taken the same sound quality and crammed it into a smaller and (slightly) more affordable box. Setup is easy thanks to a newly redesigned app, and you can even use it to turn the system into a multi room one. It also offers internet radio and high-quality Bluetooth Apt-X, and the app makes it simple to play music stored on your PC’s hard drive. Adding new services is also easy - and crucially Spotify Connect and Tidal are included. This allows the speaker to stream directly itself, without going through your phone. While many have written it off, Tidal  actually offer the highest quality files of any streaming service, and by a significant margin. 300 watts of power, with five drivers, two bass radiators and a woofer driven by its own 100-watt amp\\xa0 Set the Qb up with it, and you'll be in audio nirvana. One of the problems with the Qb is despite its smaller size, it won't fit in front of a TV, so it really does become a music only option for most.\\xa0\\xa0 However, the soundstage it produces is astonishing - clear, with amazing stereo separation for a single speaker, while bass is also excellent in all but the biggest of rooms. It'll fill all but the biggest of rooms - and I found myself staying up late into the night to listen, much to the horroe of my neighbours.\\xa0 Design wise, it's extremely simple, with one large dial to control the volume (and it's no ordinary dial, but one weighted to feel great).\\xa0 There are also a couple of touchscreen buttons on the dial to switch sources, and a USB port to plug in a devices. Like its predecessor, the Qb is worth every penny. One problem you will encounter is actually a rather unusual one - the Naim is actually too good at times, making all but the best quality files sound a little lacking.\\xa0 However, streaming services such as Spotify, and the latest downloads do sound great - while the higher quality lossless files sound absolutely stunning.  Overall, the price tag is a little intimidating, but after spending a bit of time you'll see that you really do get what you pay for - and the Naim mu:so Qb is the best all in one bookshelf speaker I've ever heard.\\xa0 Additionally, it'll also give all but the very best separates systems a run for their money - and bodes well for the British firm's chances in the US.\\xa0 \" => 1\n",

      "'Six years ago, John Barclay was out of favour at Glasgow Warriors. An injury-hit season had pushed him down the pecking order and he looked on his way out of the club. When Leicester Tigers were mentioned as a possible transfer destination, Barclay’s ears pricked up. Playing for one of the biggest clubs in Europe appealed. ‘Turns out there had been interest from somebody at Leicester but I soon realised it wasn’t Richard Cockerill,’ said the Scotland captain, laughing out loud. ‘Cockers was the man in charge back then and he had the final say. ‘I thought I was going to sign for Leicester but Richard didn’t want me. Leicester were at the peak of their powers back then and he was just not interested.’ With a mischievous look in his eyes and laughing even louder, Barclay continued: ‘Don’t think I didn’t remind him of that when he signed me for Edinburgh. ‘He has no escape from me now. When I moved into my new house in Edinburgh, turned out it was near his. ‘Me and Cockers go on a tandem bike to training every day. The two of us, top and tail on a bike. ‘No, we don’t! That last bit is an absolute lie but what a laugh that would be if we tried it. Maybe I should suggest it when I am fully fit again.’ It is great to see the Edinburgh back-row laughing and smiling after the most frustrating three months of his career. He had come off an excellent Six Nations campaign as captain of Scotland and was part of a Scarlets side, the team he signed for after he left Glasgow, trying to defend their Pro14 title. In their semi-final play-off win over Warriors at Scotstoun back in May, he went down with an Achilles’ tendon injury in the first half and has not played since. He missed the Pro14 final loss to Leinster, Scotland’s three matches on their summer tour and will not play for his new club Edinburgh at least until December at the earliest. ‘It is such a long and frustrating process coming back from this injury,’ said Barclay. ‘I have never had one like it. When I did my shoulder, I was back playing after 12 weeks and that included getting screws put in. ‘Just now, I still can’t walk properly because it is really slow in healing. It is getting better but the improvements are really small. I am in the gym doing mainly weights, on the bike a lot, not great fun. ‘I try to stay positive but it is tough, maybe even more tough mentally than physically because it is taking so long to heal, it is on my mind a lot. The physio stuff I can get on with. I don’t mind the physical pain and the rehab. ‘It is the mental side that lingers. My brain hasn’t been affected by the injury. It is still frustrated at my body for not healing quicker.’ Barclay has watched Edinburgh’s pre-season matches and believes their raft of summer signings, such as his old Glasgow Warriors team-mate Henry Pyrgos and Scotland internationals Matt Scott and Luke Hamilton, will help strengthen his new team. When he was at Warriors, their dominance over Edinburgh was strong and it continues to this day. This season, he believes the balance of power could swing back east. ‘Edinburgh seem to have been given some money to get some quality in and strengthen in the right areas,’ said Barclay. ‘There seems to be a more positive recruitment strategy, which is great for the club as maybe that was not the case in the past. ‘I see a bunch of guys who work really hard and enjoy each other’s company. It seems like the real deal here and we have the potential to turn the corner at the club and push it in the right direction. ‘We have not set any goals other than we have to be better than last year. Teams will be aware of us from last year. Everybody said we did great but we finished fifth. That praise was relative to what had gone on before. That is praise based on the past. Nobody at Edinburgh finished with a medal last year. We were beaten in the quarter-finals of the Pro14. ‘In a few years’ time, will people remember that? No, not really. You get one career and you want to do the best you can. It seems to me that the SRU and Cockers are giving the guys the best opportunity here at Edinburgh to fulfil their career potential.’ The 31-year-old has also been impressed by the young talent at the club, men like Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury and Blair Kinghorn, who all played for Scotland on their summer tour. Kinghorn is Edinburgh’s first-choice full-back but has played on the wing for Scotland, scoring a try from that position against Ireland in the last Six Nations. With Stuart Hogg at fifteen for Scotland, he believes Gregor Townsend will try to play Kinghorn on the wing in the same team. ‘I can see Gregor playing both of them,’ said Barclay. ‘You try to find spaces for your best players in your team and I can see Gregor doing that with Stuart and Blair. ‘For me, Blair is one of the best players in the league. I didn’t play against him much last year but when I did see him play for Edinburgh, he was quality. ‘Cockers said he had errors in his game last season but that might have been mind games as Cockers is very good at them. Blair is good, strong, powerful and can be something pretty special. ‘If he keeps on the trajectory he is on, I don’t see why he can’t be a future Lion. Hoggy was with the Lions when he was 21 and we can all see how world-class Hoggy is. Blair isn’t at that level yet but could be. He is an exceptionally good club player at the moment. It is up to him to prove himself regularly internationally and he can kick off from that and become a world-class player.’ With Barclay on the long-term injury list, there was no chance of him being named Edinburgh captain this season. Even if he had been fit, he still expected Stuart McInally to get the nod. ‘Rambo is the natural fit,’ he said. ‘I get on really well with Stuart. Last year, he was incredible for Edinburgh and Scotland. ‘It was important for him to first establish himself as a world-class hooker and he has done that now. He put the hours in to get to that stage. He leads by example. He is not too much of a speaker but has a good grasp of the game. He was the obvious choice.’ Mitsubishi Motors is proud to support Edinburgh Rugby and welcome John Barclay as an Official Mitsubishi Motors ambassador' => 1\n",

Planning for the elaborate celebration didn't happen overnight though, with the 27-year-old mother from the Gold Coast putting in ample time and expenses in order to the party a hit. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Posting to Instagram on Wednesday, Hannah shared some of the stylists, makeup artists, dress makers and fairytale curators who made the day possible. 'A magical day with my beautiful family, it was enchanting for the old and the young,' she said. 'Seeing all these photos makes me so emotional and excited to get married in the next couple of weeks. I'm not sure how I got so lucky to have these two in my life but no amount of memories with them will ever be enough.' The magestic day was held in the meadow pavilion at Teavine House - with the company even catering the event - for $410. Styling and florals for the day were organised by\\xa0Ivy and Bleu Events\\xa0at a base price of $495, with a last minute choice of photographer even organised on the day of the event. The flower wall ($300), cherry blossom tree ($350) and dessert buffet (prices on application) were purchased from Next Event. Balloons at $21.99 for a pack from Parties Made Pretty were arranged by specialist 'balloon stylists' on the day so they surrounded the flower wall - which was reminiscent of Kim Kardashian's wedding. But Evaliah's face lit up when the 'unicorn' Shetland pony (worth $300 per hour), jumping castle ($200 for four hours) and Cinderella entertainer ($350 for two hours) appeared. The tiny tot's dress was from etsy store\\xa0Ela Dynae Designs for $472.24 and perfectly matched her prince charming's outfit - who was another child at the party.

      "\"Rafa Benitez, the Newcastle manager, defended the tactics which led to a fallout with captain Jamaal Lascelles and were the subject of stinging criticism following the 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea. Sportsmail\\xa0revealed before Sunday's game that Lascelles had been dropped after questioning the manager's decision to play with three centre backs. The skipper wanted to be used in the middle of the three-man back line but, when posted on the right-hand side in training last week, voiced concerns and was left out of the team. Benitez stuck to his plan — using a 5-4-1 formation against the Blues — and his side showed little attacking intent during the first half. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'I don't buy into those tactics. If you're going to the Etihad, against the champions, by all means, but not at home. 'The possession stats are embarrassing. If you're a Newcastle player in that dressing room, you're embarrassed. Because you know you can play more.' Benitez hit back, saying: 'You have to drive the car you have. When I was with Liverpool we beat Real Madrid 4-0 at home, we were offensive, when I was at Napoli I was offensive, attacking all the time. I would like to play with five strikers if I could. 'When I am at Newcastle United I have to manage, I have what I have.' Chelsea, whose winner came in the 87th minute when DeAndre Yedlin put through his own goal, had 81 per cent possession despite being the away team. Benitez countered: 'A long time ago, Barcelona had 80 per cent against 20 per cent against Celtic and they lost the game, the stats are just for the TV. 'Saturday, at Wolves, Man City had 71 per cent possession and didn't win. You have to do what you have to do, and we were nearly there, very close. I don't remember Chelsea making too many chances in the second half.' Chelsea coach Maurizio Sarri said: 'We knew it would be difficult — Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal lost here last season. It is not easy. 'But in Italy I have never seen Rafa play with five defenders, it was so compact. So it was difficult. We needed to move the ball very fast and be patient.' The win puts Chelsea level on maximum points with Watford and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, but Sarri added: 'It means nothing. The honour is on 38 games, not three. It's important to start well. But now, the table is not important.' Meanwhile, Benitez claimed Lascelles was missing because of an ankle injury but did not deny a fall-out. 'If players have different opinions then we have to speak about it, that's it, and then we stick to the plan.'\\xa0\" => 0\n",

      "\"Awareness is rising worldwide about the scourge of ocean plastic pollution, from Earth Day 2018 events to the cover of National Geographic magazine.\\xa0 But few people realize that similar concentrations of plastic pollution are accumulating in lakes and rivers.\\xa0 One recent study found microplastic particles – fragments measuring less then five millimeters – in globally sourced tap water and beer brewed with water from the Great Lakes. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Plastic enters the Great Lakes in many ways.\\xa0 People on the shore and on boats throw litter in the water.\\xa0 Microplastic pollution also comes from wastewater treatment plants, stormwater and agricultural runoff.\\xa0 Some plastic fibers become airborne – possibly from clothing or building materials weathering outdoors – and are probably deposited into the lakes directly from the air. \\xa0 According to recent estimates, over 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year.\\xa0 Using that study's calculations of how much plastic pollution per person enters the water in coastal regions, one of us (Matthew Hoffman) has estimated that around 10,000 tons of plastic enter the Great Lakes annually.\\xa0 Now we are analyzing where it accumulates and how it may affect aquatic life. Plastic enters the Great Lakes in many ways.\\xa0 People on the shore and on boats throw litter in the water.\\xa0 Microplastic pollution also comes from wastewater treatment plants, stormwaterand agricultural runoff.\\xa0 Some plastic fibers become airborne – possibly from clothing or building materials weathering outdoors – and are probably deposited into the lakes directly from the air. Sampling natural water bodies for plastic particles is time-consuming and can be done on only a small fraction of any given river or lake. To augment actual sampling, researchers can use computational models to map how plastic pollution will move once it enters the water.\\xa0 In the ocean, these models show how plastic accumulates in particular locations around the globe, including the Arctic. Three-dimensional transport simulations of particle movement in Lake Erie, based on water current models developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration When plastic pollution was initially found in the Great Lakes, many observers feared that it could accumulate in large floating garbage patches, like those created by ocean currents.\\xa0 However, when we used our computational models to predict how plastic pollution would move around in the surface waters of Lake Erie, we found that temporary accumulation regions formed but did not persist as they do in the ocean.\\xa0 In Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes, strong winds break up the accumulation regions. Subsequent simulations have also found no evidence for a Great Lakes garbage patch.\\xa0 Initially this seems like good news. But we know that a lot of plastic is entering the lakes.\\xa0 If it is not accumulating at their centers, where is it? Using our models, we created maps that predict the average surface distribution of Great Lakes plastic pollution.\\xa0 They show that most of it ends up closer to shore.\\xa0 This helps to explain why so much plastic is found on Great Lakes beaches: In 2017 alone, volunteers with the Alliance for the Great Lakes collected more than 16 tons of plastic at beach cleanups.\\xa0 If more plastic is ending up near shore, where more wildlife is located and where we obtain our drinking water, is that really a better outcome than a garbage patch? According to an article\\xa0published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, our understanding of the potential human health effects from exposure to microplastics 'constitutes major knowledge gaps.'\\xa0 Humans can be exposed to plastic particles via consumption of seafood and terrestrial food products, drinking water and via the air.\\xa0 However, the level of human exposure, chronic toxic effect concentrations and underlying mechanisms by which microplastics elicit effects are still not well understood enough in order to make a full assessment of the risks to humans. According to Rachel Adams, a senior lecturer in Biomedical Science at Cardiff Metropolitan University, ingesting microplastics could cause a number of potentially harmful effects, such as:\\xa0 We estimate that over four tons of microplastic are floating in Lake Erie.\\xa0 This figure is only a small fraction of the approximately 2,500 tons of plastic that we estimate enter the Lake each year.\\xa0 Similarly, researchers have found that their estimates of how much plastic is floating at the ocean's surface account for only around 1 percent of estimated input.\\xa0 Plastic pollution has adverse effects on many organisms, and to predict which ecosystems and organisms are most affected, it is essential to understand where it is going. We have begun using more advanced computer models to map the three-dimensional distribution of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes.\\xa0 Assuming that plastic simply moves with currents, we see that a large proportion of it is predicted to sink to lake bottoms.\\xa0 Mapping plastic pollution this way begins to shed light on exposure risks for different species, based on where in the lake they live.\\xa0 According to our initial simulations, much of the plastic is expected to sink.\\xa0 This prediction is supported by sediment samples collected from the bottom of the Great Lakes, which can contain high concentrations of plastic. In a real lake, plastic does not just move with the current. It also can float or sink, based on its size and density.\\xa0 As a particle floats and is 'weathered' by sun and waves, breaks into smaller particles, and becomes colonized by bacteria and other microorganisms, its ability to sink will change. Better understanding of the processes that affect plastic transport will enable us to generate more accurate models of how it moves through the water.\\xa0 In addition, we know little so far about how plastic is removed from the water as it lands on the bottom or the beach, or is ingested by organisms. Ten years ago, the Mail launched a trailblazing campaign to rid Britain of the scourge of plastic supermarket bags — prompted by a heartrending, shaming picture of an endangered turtle entangled in one, which was used on the front page. The success of our Banish The Bags initiative has been nothing short of phenomenal.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Now, in a landmark series that could have just as big an impact as that front page a decade ago, we’re here to assure you that you really can make a difference — and your actions can help save our beautiful world and its animals.\\xa0 The Mail’s Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign isn’t intended to make you feel guilty about plastic you depend on. Instead, this series will guide you through small daily steps you can take — with little expense or effort — to make dramatic inroads into reducing the amount of plastic you use.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Even simply changing one habit — such as using the reusable coffee cup we’re giving away today, instead of a throwaway cup — will help decrease the demand for new plastics. If every Daily Mail reader uses their cup just once a day in place of a takeaway cup, millions of plastic-lined paper cups will be saved from landfill in a year. It’s simple maths. Use a plastic bag twice and you halve your plastic footprint. Buy one bar of soap and you may spare the planet two or even three pump-action hand wash bottles. Inspire someone else and the impact is doubled. We’ll tell you how to double your recycling efficiency overnight, banish plastic from your kitchen and dodge food packaging. Better yet, you can even shop to save the planet with gorgeous — and reusable — plastic alternatives. It’s never too late to start…\\xa0 Developing a complete picture of how plastic pollution travels through waterways, and which habitats are most at risk, is crucial for conceiving and testing possible solutions. If we can accurately track different types of plastic pollution after they enter the water, we can focus on the types that end up in sensitive habitats and predict their ultimate fate. Of course, preventing plastic from entering our waterways in the first place is the best way to eliminate the problem.\\xa0 But by determining which plastics are more toxic and also more likely to come into contact with sensitive organisms, or end up in our water supply, we can target the 'worst of the worst.'\\xa0 With this information, government agencies and conservation groups can develop specific community education programs, target cleanup efforts and work with industries to develop alternatives to products that contain these materials. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

After 20 years, 20 seasons, four Emmy Awards and hundreds of hours of social and political satire, the South Park franchise continues to be both a commercial and critical success.\\xa0 With over 280 episodes, it remains one of Comedy Central’s highest rated programs.

In 2014 developers Obsidian Entertainment released South Park: The Stick of Truth – an RPG written by Stone and Parker with a visual style that replicates the series - to critical acclaim. At E3 the following year, the sequel South Park: The Fractured But Whole was announced with Ubisoft San Francisco taking over the reins. The Fractured But Whole takes place directly after the events of The Stick of Truth and centres around the children roleplaying superheroes and trying to launch a Netflix film franchise.\\xa0 With The Stick of Truth’s fantasy theme offering classic archetypes like Fighter, Thief and Mage, The Fractured But Whole’s classes are appropriately superhero themed, with players having access to up to ten different options including Speedster, Cyborg, Psychic and Blaster.\\xa0 However, this time around the game allows the player to completely customise their character’s powers and mix and match abilities from different classes.\\xa0 This gives the gameplay much greater depth and allows the player to adapt their character to different scenarios. If the player favours brawn over brains and wants to run into battle and smash the enemy with powerful attacks, decking out their character with abilities from the Brutalist and Blaster classes would certainly do the trick.\\xa0 More cautious players may prefer to pick powers from the Psychic and Plantmaker classes, giving them the ability to heal and protect their allies. The combat in Fractured But Whole has been significantly improved from the purely turn-based combat of The Stick of Truth.\\xa0 It adds a number of different elements – including grid-based strategies and an increased party size of four – to the mix. Players now have the ability to move around the combat area and powers have a precise range, hit box and effect, meaning that players are constantly having to position their heroes to inflict the greatest damage, hit the most enemies or dodge an enemy’s attack. The movement changes - coupled with a new artifact system that allows players to equip items like an alien probe, golden fidget spinner or the ‘dreidel of vengeance’ for specific team bonuses like knockback damage and bonus ally health - bring a whole new level of depth to customisation, character development and combat throughout the game. Another big change from Stick of Truth is that the choices players make when choosing what costumes to wear have no impact on any combat or gameplay stats: they're purely aesthetic. This is a great change as it means players are no longer forced to wear certain outfits to have the best stats and can instead tailor their hero in whatever fashion they desire (even if that means ignoring the conventional superhero options and wearing a bra on their head or dressing as a shark). In between battling sixth graders, crooked cops and crab people, players are free to explore the quiet mountain town of South Park, which features many sidequests, environmental puzzles (some of which can’t be unlocked until the appropriate ally has joined your team), easter eggs and lots of collectibles to keep the diehard fan sated. Some of the best moments in Fractured But Whole were the random encounters or throwbacks to the show discovered while exploring South Park, with Ubisoft cramming in as many references as they could into every nook and cranny of the town. Of course it wouldn’t be a South Park game without Parker and Stone’s fantastic voice acting, hilarious celebrity parodies, pointed social and policitical commentary and the trademark inflammatory humour.\\xa0 The Fractured But Whole has more than enough side-splitting gags to go around, as well as some surprisingly thought-provoking moments too. At times during the 20+ hours it took to finish the game it was easy to forget you were actually playing and not just watching an extended episode of the show – which is a credit to Parker and Stone’s great dialogue and the team at Ubisoft San Francisco. South Park: The Fractured But Whole is about as close to a perfect sequel as you can get, with Ubisoft building and improving nearly every aspect of the game while staying true to the authenticity and themes of the show. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

Scroll down for video\\xa0\\xa0 Richard Russell of the Department of Psychology at Gettysburg College conducted the research and looked at\\xa032 women in four age bands – approximately 20, 30, 40 and 50 years old. Richard Russell said: 'In many contexts there are rules regulating when a girl can begin wearing makeup.\\xa0 'To the extent that women are more likely than girls to wear makeup, people may learn to implicitly associate makeup with adulthood. 'Because age discrimination is pervasive in employment contexts, particularly for women, the ability to manipulate perceived age through makeup may provide critical professional benefits.'\\xa0 Each face was first photographed with no makeup before a professional make-up artist gave each participant a makeover.\\xa0 The women were then photographed in identical conditions and lighting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Participants were then asked to estimate the age of each face, with an interactive scale ranking from 10 to 70.\\xa0\\xa0 As well as guessing age, each person ranked the images based on attractiveness.\\xa0\\xa0 The findings, published in the\\xa0British Journal of Psychology, showed that make-up made the middle-aged faces appear younger. However, the same products made the youngest adult faces appear older. The study found make up applied only to the skin and eye region had a significant effect on perceived age, compared to makeup applied only to the skin and lips.

      "\"Celtic are looking into a loan deal for Leicester City's new £13million Croatian central defender Filip Benkovic, with Dedryck Boyata still expected to leave the club before Friday's transfer deadline. Brendan Rodgers praised his want-away defender for responding to the boos of Celtic supporters with a match-winning goal against Hamilton on Sunday. Accused of downing tools after the Parkhead club refused to sell him to Fulham for £9m, the Belgian defender is expected to depart if Celtic can secure a replacement. And Sportsmail understands that Benkovic, yet to make a first-team appearance since signing for Leicester on English deadline day earlier this month, has joined Aberdeen's Scott McKenna and Le Havre's Harold Moukoudi on a list of potential reinforcements. After an initial bid of £3.5m was rejected by the Dons, Celtic could yet make a fresh offer for McKenna. 'It is a position we'll definitely be looking at,' said Rodgers after a 1-0 win over Accies. 'It's an area that, with the likes of Jack Hendry and Jozo Simunovic injured, we will be looking at.'\\xa0 Restored to the starting line-up after missing games against Hearts, AEK Athens, Partick Thistle and Suduva, Boyata was booed by Celtic fans before kick-off, with the Green Brigade ultras holding aloft a banner which read: 'Boyata - not fit to wear the jersey'. Praising the under-fire defender for doing his talking on the pitch after other fans tried to drown out the boos with cheers, however, Rodgers said: 'Obviously, I would have preferred a different reaction, but I'm not going to criticise the supporters. 'I will give credit to Dedryck and how he coped with it and I think you saw the reaction from three-quarters of the stadium. 'When you try to redeem yourself, it sometimes takes a bit of time with these things. Naturally, supporters - and the passionate supporters - look for that commitment in a player. 'It's not always about ability, it's about commitment when they pull on the shirt. 'I always knew if Dedryck put on the shirt, he'd be first-class. The reaction of three-quarters of the stadium plus his team-mates, I think you saw we're all together. 'You do your talking on your pitch.' Having previously declared himself physically and mentally unfit for action, Boyata produced a fine performance under trying circumstances after a shock recall to the starting XI. 'It was a pretty easy decision because we've been waiting for him,' added Rodgers. 'Like he showed, he cruised the game because he is a top-class player. 'We are not a squad which can do without a player of that quality. He made his commitment to the team and was there for his team-mates. He was first-class and it was ironic that he got the goal. Everything he did was superb and it was great to have him back in there. 'It's not been an easy time for us all in relation to that matter. But when we came back from Lithuania, we had a couple of days when we spoke a lot. 'We knew it was a watershed moment and we had to go one of two ways. The players and staff all came out of it knowing which direction we wanted to go in. 'Everyone is very focused on having another great season. 'It was great for him to score. He is an outstanding footballer and it was good to have him out there with his team-mates.' Asked if he still expects to have Boyata around after Friday's deadline, Rodgers shrugged: 'I'm not thinking anything other than that. He's in his last year of his contract and you never know how the game works. 'But, like I said to him, however long you are here - whether it's a week or the rest of the season - your best place is on the training field and out on the pitch on a match-day. 'So we want him there. He's been a big part of what we have done for the last couple of years. I respect that a football career is short and you have to maximise your playing time. 'We will see what happens this week but I'm not planning for anything other than Dedryck being here.'\" => 0\n",

      "\"A new species of 'toothy' pterodactyl with vampire-like fangs soared above the Utah desert 200 million years ago, new fossils have revealed. The newly-discovered reptile is named Caelestiventus hanseni\\xa0– Latin for 'heavenly wind'\\xa0– and had a wingspan of five feet (1.5 metres), making it the biggest example of an early pterodactyl species. Caelestiventus hanseni (C. hanseni) lived between 201 and 210 million years ago beside a lake in Utah, during a time when North America was much hotter and drier than it is today. Until now, the only other known pterodactyl, or pterosaur, from this age came from the coasts of Europe, including the UK and Greenland. The new fossil predates all known 'desert pterosaurs' by more than 65 million years.\\xa0 The latest finding shows the earliest pterodactyls were geographically widely distributed and ecologically diverse\\xa0– even able to thrive in harsh desert environments. It may explain how they survived a mass extinction, which also fell around 200 million years ago and killed-off half of the world's species. Scroll down for video The pterodactyls were were remarkably successful, ruling the skies for over 160 million years. They were the second animals after insects to evolve powered flight\\xa0– not just leaping or gliding, but flapping their wings to generate lift and travel through the air. A dramatic shift in the carbon cycle 200 million years ago, which scientists say was triggered by a series of massive volcanic eruptions, led to a sustained period of climate change. Many types of animal died out, including other reptiles, large amphibians and reef-building creatures – however, pterodactyls survived. Scientists believe the new fossil,\\xa0found at Saints and Sinners Quarry outside Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, might hold the secret to their success. 'In the latest Triassic, this area of North America was more arid and hot than it is today, indicating C. hanseni could cope with extreme desert conditions,' said palaeontologist Professor Brooks Britt, who is the lead researcher from\\xa0Brigham Young University in Utah. This shows ptersaurs could tolerate a variety of environmental conditions and therefore would have been more resilient to sudden changes of climate, according to the paper published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.\\xa0 'Triassic pterosaurs are extraordinarily rare and all but one specimen come from marine deposits in the Alps,' said Professor Britt. 'Caelestiventus hanseni shows the earliest pterosaurs were geographically widely distributed and ecologically diverse, even living in harsh desert environments.' This ancient creature had a pelican style pouch, which it could use to store the prey it snatched.\\xa0 The primitive 'beak bag' was also used to attract potential mates\\xa0– and emit throaty high pitched calls. Neither birds nor bats, pterosaurs were reptiles who ruled the skies in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Scientists have long debated where pterosaurs fit on the evolutionary tree. The leading theory today is that pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and crocodiles are closely related and belong to a group known as archosaurs, but this is still unconfirmed. Pterosaurs evolved into dozens of species. Some were as large as an F-16 fighter jet, and others as small as a sparrow. They were the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight - not just leaping or gliding, but flapping their wings to generate lift and travel through the air. Pterosaurs had hollow bones, large brains with well-developed optic lobes, and several crests on their bones to which flight muscles attached.\\xa0 Huge bony sockets show it had around half a dozen 'fang like' teeth in the front of its mouth and at least three dozen pairs of smaller ones. A projecting rim on the lower jaw suggests C. hanseni had a throat pouch 'similar to those of modern day pelicans,' said Professor Britt. 'A gular pouch may also function in visual display and vocal communication, as in male frigate birds or the flying lizard Draco.' The bones from the fossil belonged to a single individual, possibly a juvenile, that died in the water and sank to the bottom, becoming entombed in silty, fine sandstone.\\xa0 Professor Britt said: 'Based on skull length and estimated wing span, C. hanseni is one of the largest Triassic pterosaurs, if not the largest.'\\xa0 Some pterosaurs had wingspans of up to 35 feet (10 metres)\\xa0– as big as a fighter jet\\xa0– while others were as small as a sparrow.\\xa0 Pterosaurs had hollow bones, large brains with well-developed optic lobes, and several crests on their bones to which flight muscles attached. The fossil record of pterosaurs, which lived alongside the dinosaurs but were unrelated to birds, is patchy. Their bones were fragile and few of the creatures lived in places where fossils form easily, making pterosaur finds rare. Traditionally, scientists have referred to the 'Big Five' mass extinctions, including perhaps the most famous mass extinction triggered by a meteorite impact that brought about the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\\xa0 But the other major mass extinctions were caused by phenomena originating entirely on Earth, and while they are less well known, we may learn something from exploring them that could shed light on our current environmental crises. \\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"It\\xa0would be wrong to confer too much importance on the actions of fans who hire planes to fly protest banners over football stadiums but it feels instructive to recall that, when Arsenal supporters wanted to demonstrate their unease about the direction their club was taking, they chose their greatest ever manager, Arsene Wenger, not their chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, as the object of their sky-high ire. When Manchester United fans attempt a similar stunt ahead of the game against Burnley next Sunday, the club's manager, Jose Mourinho, will not be the headline act. Wenger never complained about the money he was given to spend but Mourinho is not like that and so it is Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, who will take the flak, even though he has given him hundreds of millions of pounds for new arrivals. That Mourinho would play this game with Woodward at some point was eminently predictable. Woodward is a smart man. When he appointed Mourinho, he must have known what he was getting. Everyone else did. He was getting a shock jock. Not an empire builder. He was getting short term. Not long term. He was getting four years. Maximum. He was getting a guy who comes in, wows a club with his charisma and his record, alienates all but the fans of the club he is managing, picks fights, makes enemies, makes it all about him, takes flight on a magic-carpet ride of unbridled narcissism, lives for the now, stifles attacking football and attacking footballers, plays it for the short term and moves on. He was getting a manager who descends into a fog of discord, who has a habit of turning his relationship with his own club into one bloody battle after another. Exhibit A here is the needless, vituperative, vindictive fall-out with Eva Carneiro in Chelsea's first game of the 2015-16 season. By the time Mourinho was sacked that December, Chelsea were in 16th place. Now, with this season only two games old, we are back in the maelstrom that is Mourinho's natural habitat. Now, he is simmering and sullen and boiling with resentments, aiming withering sarcasm at TV reporters, serving up withering answers in press conferences. Watching him implode is like watching a movie on a loop: the same thing happens time after time after time. Sure this season is in its infancy and, starting with Monday night's clash with Spurs at Old Trafford, things may yet improve. Tottenham have a rotten record in Stretford and their boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has been to Old Trafford four times in the league and never once seen his team score or pick up a point. A win for United against Spurs, a team perceived to be full of the vitality and togetherness that United lack, would be a fillip for Mourinho. But the worry for the United hierarchy is that their manager is starting to draw patterns that presage more and more problems. All the signs are there: internal squabbles with Woodward, issues with talented but headstrong individual players such as Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial and antipathy towards the media. On Friday, he turned up for his press conference at Carrington half an hour early and then answered broadcasters' questions for 259 seconds. Even those who did not miss the conference altogether were treated to terse, tense answers. Yeah, I know. Boo-hoo. The media set-up at Old Trafford has been amateur hour for some time now and a few sports reporters missing a press conference is hardly the end of the world. But that is not the point. The point is that when Mourinho starts to act like this, it is usually all over by Christmas. He knew that by starting the conference early, he would generate another cycle of negative headlines. He and United are stuck in a spiral of antagonism and the constant conflict appears to be sapping their energy while Manchester City and Liverpool ride waves of positivity. It is hard not to feel some sympathy for Woodward. He is clearly an extremely smart commercial operator who has been a generous benefactor to Mourinho. But he is discovering the kind of operator he is up against. It was a big call to balk at Mourinho's wish-list in the summer transfer window and Mourinho has not reacted well to it.\\xa0 As Gary Neville pointed out last week, Woodward's withdrawal of financial backing for Mourinho came at a curious time. If you are in, you have to be in all the way. The way Woodward has acted, it looks as if he and the board have lost confidence in the manager. The problem for Woodward is that Mourinho is just being Mourinho. There are only two games of the season gone but already it is beginning to feel like the dawn of his tumultuous final season at Chelsea in 2015-16, when he became stuck in a cycle of despondency and aggravation. This is how it always plays out with him. Woodward must have known that. Everyone else did. There is no point trying to change Mourinho because he does not know any other way. Either you keep backing him, either you keep faith in the philosophy you bought into when you appointed him, or you get rid of him. Either you ride with him all the way into his world of eternal conflict or you look for someone else. When you appoint Mourinho, don't be surprised when he's not Guardiola. Don't be surprised when he's not Klopp. Or Pochettino. When you sign Mourinho, don't be surprised when you don't get beautiful football every week. Don't be surprised when your club looks like it's stuck in a time warp. Don't be surprised if your popularity goes down the tubes and if fans hire planes to fly banners over stadiums calling for you to be fired. Woodward gave Mourinho a new contract earlier this year. He is getting what he paid for. As the beginning of the NFL season approaches, President Trump continues to vilify those players who have chosen to protest — by taking a knee during the pre-game national anthem — against the epidemic of killings of unarmed black men by law enforcement agencies and over other civil rights issues. Thankfully, the players standing up for their principles have their champions, too, and few have articulated their case more powerfully than Democrat Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, running against Ted Cruz in Texas. O'Rourke referenced the peaceful protests of Rosa Parks, the Freedom Riders and those who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in 1965 as he put what the NFL players are doing into historical context. 'And so, non-violently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching these games,' O'Rourke told his audience, 'they take a knee, to bring our attention and our focus to this problem, to ensure we fix it. 'That is why they do it and I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, any time, anywhere, any place.' O'Rourke's words may not chime with everyone but in this corner, it felt like he just scored a touchdown.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

The new title will allow players to enrol as\\xa0members of the \\'Red Orchestra\\', a network of groups who fought the Nazis before and during World War II.

A 1998 court ruling had blocked video games from using Nazi symbols, with judges fearing at the time that children \\'will grow up with these symbols and insignia and grow accustomed to them\\'.\\xa0 Joerg Friedrich, one of the developers of the new video game, says previous restrictions on Nazi symbols had \\'simply hushed up\\' a period of history. Gamers have long chafed at the restrictions, which have often meant a different experience for German players than for those abroad. \\'It\\'s a past that we don\\'t necessarily have to hide, it can also be a warning,\\' said Gamescom visitor Michael Schiessl. Others argue that the swastika should remain taboo, fearing real-world consequences. \\'We shouldn\\'t play with swastikas,\\' Family Affairs Minister Franziska Giffey told the Funke newspaper group on Thursday. Germans above all must \\'always be conscious of their particular historical responsibility, even today\\', she added. Stefan Mannes, who runs an online information portal on the Third Reich named \\'The Future Needs Remembrance\\', was blunter. He asked how one could explain to youths who are exposed to swastikas in video games \\'that they\\'ll be prosecuted if they spray one on a wall?\\' \\'One doesn\\'t become a Nazi just by seeing a swastika,\\' countered Klaus-Peter Sick, a historian at Berlin\\'s Marc Bloch Centre, a Franco-German social sciences research centre. \\'Players are intelligent and know how to tell the difference\\' between fiction and reality, he added.\\xa0 Self-regulation organisation USK has only slightly loosened its rules. There will be no general permission for Nazi signs, but case-by-case decisions on whether their use is \\'socially appropriate\\'. Other art forms have already blazed a trail in recent years, with many movies for the first time daring to satirise the dictator. Films like \\'My Fuehrer: The Really Truest Truth about Adolf Hitler\\' (2007), \\'Heil: A Neo-Nazi farce\\' (2015) and \\'Look Who\\'s Back\\' (2015), based on the best-selling novel of the same name, have packed cinemas. And a new edition of Hitler\\'s \\'Mein Kampf\\' – accompanied with reams of historical annotations – was published in 2016. On the other hand, concern is growing over a resurgent and newly emboldened right-wing extremist and anti-immigration movement. Leading figures of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have attacked Germany\\'s culture of remembrance of Nazi crimes and even sought to rehabilitate its soldiers of the two world wars. Historian Klaus-Peter Sick nonetheless sees the video gaming move as another sign of \\'normalisation\\' in Germany\\'s relationship with its dark past. \\'This society is able to read \\'Mein Kampf\\' without becoming nostalgic. The dedicated Nazis are dead,\\' he argued. \\'It\\'s a generational question: society has transformed itself and is now far from this period to which it no longer wants to return.\\'' => 1\n",

Karen admitted she only changed her bed sheets every three, or sometimes four, weeks, and doesn't ever clean the mattress she's been sleeping on for three years. Alice Beer and hygiene expert Luke Rutterford hoovered the bed to find out what germs were lurking, and then revealed how they had captured a murky bowl of dirty liquid hidden in her mattress. Rutterford warned she may also have dust mites in the fabric, prompting viewers to call her bed 'rank' and 'grubby'. Karen admitted that when things get 'hectic' she can leave her bed sheets up to four weeks without washing them. Her mattress is just three years old while her son Joel's was bought 12 years ago, and both - which have never been cleaned - were tested on the show. Rutterford hoovered both mattresses to see how dirty they were without any cleaning. While Karen's mattress looked squeaky clean to the naked eye, she was shocked by the bowl of dirty liquid that emerged. She said: 'That’s shocking absolutely shocking. I cant believe how much dirt is in there.'\\xa0 Viewers were left gobsmacked  and took to Twitter to say that Karen should be cleaning her sheets more often. One tweeted: 'I reckon I could go my whole life without knowing how grubby people's beds are.' 'Not changing your bed for 4 weeks is rank,' another said followed by sick emojis. A third tweeted: 'People don’t actually change their bedding for 3 weeks? #shocked.' The show revealed that one in ten people will wait a month to change their bed sheets, and only a third of people will put fresh sheets on every fortnight. Rutterford advised going over mattresses with a hoover to get rid of the dirt that you can't see. When cleaning the mattress windows should be kept open so it can be aired out.\\xa0 He said sheets should be washed at least once a week on a hot wash of over 60 degrees.\" => 1\n",

      "\"Scientists have recreated the face of a Mayan woman who met her untimely end nearly 14,000 years ago at the bottom of a sinkhole. The remains of Eve, or ‘the Woman of Naharon,’ were discovered hundreds of feet beneath the surface in an underwater cave in Mexico’s Sistema Naranjal in the early 2000s. Using forensic facial reconstruction techniques, researchers have now revealed what she may have looked like in life. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Studies carried out after Eve’s discovery indicated she once stood about 4.6 feet tall, according to the Spanish news agency EFE. She was about 20-25 years old when she died. According to the researchers, the remains discovered by underwater researcher Octavio del Rio still contained about 80 percent of the skeleton’s original structure. To put a face to the bones, the National Anthropology and History Institute (INAH) teamed up with Brazilian 3D designer Cicero Moraes, who used scans of the skull to build a realistic representation of the skin and features that once covered it. ‘The technique basically entails creating a virtual 3D representation from the real skull,’ Del Rio told EFE. Eve’s remains were found about 386 meters beneath the surface of Naharon cenote – a 22.6 meter sinkhole in the cave system of Mexico's Quintana Roo.\\xa0 And, she isn’t the only one to suffer such a tragic demise in the region. Archaeologists in recent years have discovered the remains of eight other ancient people in the underwater caves, including the famous bones of the young girl ‘Naia.’ All are estimated to be about 11,000-14,000 years old. For hundreds of years the Mayans dominated large parts of the Americas until, mysteriously in the 8th and 9th century AD, a large chunk of the Mayan civilisation collapsed. The reason for this collapse has been hotly debated, but now scientists say they might have an answer - an intense drought that lasted a century. Studies of sediments in the Great Blue Hole in Belize suggest a lack of rains caused the disintegration of the Mayan civilisation, and a second dry spell forced them to relocate elsewhere. The theory that a drought led to a decline of the Mayan Classic Period is not entirely new, but the new study co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides fresh evidence for the claims. Dozens of theories have attempted to explain the Classic Maya Collapse, from epidemic diseases to foreign invasion.\\xa0 With his team Dr Droxler found that from 800 to 1000 AD, no more than two tropical cyclones occurred every two decades, when usually there were up to six. This suggests major droughts occurred in these years, possibly leading to famines and unrest among the Mayan people.\\xa0 And they also found that a second drought hit from 1000 to 1100 AD, corresponding to the time that the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá collapsed.\\xa0 Researchers say a climate reversal and drying trend between 660 and 1000 AD triggered political competition, increased warfare, overall sociopolitical instability, and finally, political collapse - known as the Classic Maya Collapse. This was followed by an extended drought between AD 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures, death, famine, migration and, ultimately, the collapse of the Maya population. Eve of Naharon is said to be among the oldest human remains found in the Americas, with analyses indicating the skeleton is about 13,600 years old. The details of her are largely a mystery, though the people living in Yucatan at the time she was alive were known to be hunter-gatherers. Yucatan’s caves weren’t always underwater; towards the end of the Ice Age, rising sea levels swallowed up the area. Experts also say the sites were sometimes used for ancient Maya rituals, including sacrificial offerings.\" => 1\n",

Married to actor Simon MacCorkindale for 26 years until his death from cancer in 2010, she now lives in Somerset, where she runs a stud farm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 During the making of Straw Dogs, I vividly remember the moment I was asked — or, rather, told — by the director Sam Peckinpah what was expected of me during the movie’s infamous rape scene. It was to do with the nudity and what was asked of me, which I just didn’t think was necessary. This was such an important film so, aged 21, I stuck to my guns and told him so. I explained that I could tell the story a thousand times better if he were to allow me to do it through my eyes. Very fortunately, we came to a compromise. Up to that point, I knew I was strong-willed, but I didn’t know I had that much power of will. The consequences of saying ‘no’ hadn’t even crossed my mind. This realisation that you have to be true to yourself made a huge impression on me and has pretty much coloured my entire life. There were plenty of other movies where I was pushed to the limit, but I nearly always stood my ground, even if it got me into trouble. You have to remember that, even if your feelings are different to someone else’s, they are your feelings and should be allowed to be vented. Holding back is never a good thing. That said, you sometimes have to curb the truth for kindness. Aged 12, I played Brigitta in The Sound Of Music and she was the character who always told the truth. I realised then that the truth can be hurtful. I now always try to find the kindest way of saying something. The other thing to remember is that, while you might not always make the right decisions long-term, there is usually a reason for that decision that makes it right at the time. So I don’t overthink things and I don’t analyse. And, because of the way I’ve lived my life, I have no regrets.

      "\"Stargazers will be treated to a much clearer view of the red planet tonight, as Mars will appear bigger and brighter in the night sky than it has for the last 15 years. Throughout the month of July, the orbits of Mars and Earth have been steadily aligning in a rare phenomenon known as 'perihelic opposition', which\\xa0occurs when\\xa0Mars, Earth, and the sun align – with our planet in the middle. As a result, Mars will\\xa0appear almost three times larger than normal in the night sky. According to Nasa, Mars' orbit only brings the red planet this close to Earth every 15 to 17 years, meaning the next time Mars will be seen as prominently in the night sky will be September 15, 2035. Stargazers all over the world will be able to see the red planet in all its glory today – provided they have clear skies. However, astronomers in the southern hemisphere will be treated to the best view as Mars will appear higher in the night sky.\\xa0 The exact moment of closest approach took place at 8:45am BST (3:45am EDT) July 31, however, Mars was invisible to amateur stargazers in Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia as it was daylight.\\xa0 As the sun sets later today, July 31, those looking up at the night sky with nothing but their naked eye will be treated to a stunning view of Mars. The perihelic opposition comes just a few days after another stunning celestial event, the 'Blood Moon' lunar eclipse, which saw people in Europe, Asia, Africa, parts of Australasia and South America treated to the longest lunar eclipse of this century, with our natural satellite taking on a deep crimson hue in the process. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Dr Mark Birkinshaw, a professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics at the University of Bristol, told MailOnline:\\xa0'Mars is unusually close to the Earth at the present – it makes its closest approach on July 31, at 0.385 AU (35.7 million miles/57.5 million km).'\\xa0 Earth is separated from Mars by an asteroid belt, with the typical distance between the two planets sitting at around 140 million miles (225 million kilometres). However, tonight that will drop to\\xa035.78 million miles (57.59 million kilometres). For those in the northern hemisphere, Mars will appear to rise in the east just as the sun sets in the west, making the sunlit side of the planet visible throughout the night. Mars should be visible in the southeast, located just below the Sagittarius constellation, with Saturn also nearby.\\xa0 The best views will be visible in the hours before dawn. Those in the southern hemisphere will be treated to the best view of the perihelic opposition, as the red planet will appear higher in the night sky. On July 27, Mars will pass closer to Earth than it has done for 15 years. The phenomenon, known as perihelic opposition, will make the red planet appear larger and brighter than normal in the night sky. The rare event occurs when Mars reaches its closest point to the sun as the same time as Earth's orbit brings it directly between the two. Although the actual point of\\xa0opposition will take place on July 27, Mars\\xa0will be noticeably larger for the majority of the month of July. Perihelic opposition can be seen with the naked eye, meaning there's no need for expensive equipment for stargazers to spot the rare event next month.\\xa0 It will outshine Jupiter, registering as some 1.8 times brighter in the night sky. Mars will be up all night, rising after sunset and setting at sunrise. Stargazers hoping to spot the red planet from the northern hemisphere should check the sky in the hours before dawn. Mars should be visible in the southeast, located just below the Sagittarius constellation. Meanwhile, the best view of the phenomenon will be\\xa0enjoyed in the southern hemisphere.\\xa0 For example, New Zealand capital Wellington will enjoy a view of the red planet as it reaches a maximum altitude of 74 degrees in the sky at the end of July. For people unable to get outside or those with a view hindered by cloud cover,\\xa0The Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles will air a\\xa0webcast for the celestial event, which will be coupled with expert commentary. 'The closeness and brightness of Mars, plus the near location of Saturn (Mars and Saturn were in conjunction in early April) should make this good to observe,' Dr Birkinshaw said. In the days before Mars Close Approach, the planet will look around three times brighter in our sky than it normally does. It will also outshine Jupiter, registering as 1.8 times brighter in the night sky. That means Mars will temporarily become the fourth-brightest object in the sky, ranking after the sun, the moon and Venus. Mars will be up all night, rising after sunset and setting just before sunrise. Opposition is a reasonably common occurrence, taking place once every 26 months. This is where Earth is sandwiched directly between the sun and Mars, in a similar fashion to the way it aligns itself with the moon each month. However, due to the variation between the orbits of Earth and Mars, opposition can happen anywhere along Mars' orbit. What makes this particular event so rare, is that the position of the Earth between the red planet and sun will occur within a few weeks of Mars' perihelion — the point in its orbit when it is closest to the sun. This coincidence, known as perihelic opposition, only happens every 15 to 17 years. The last time it happened was in 2003, and on that occasion the two planets were closer than they had been for almost 60,000 years. During that opposition, Mars was only 34.65 million miles (55.76 million kilometres) from the surface of our planet. This exact level of proximity will not happen again until\\xa0until August 29 2287, according to some estimates. Earth makes two trips around the sun in around the same amount of time that Mars takes to make one trip. This means sometimes the two planets are on opposite sides of the sun, very far apart, and other times, Earth catches up with its neighbour and passes relatively close to it. During opposition, Mars and the sun are on directly opposite sides of Earth. The effect of opposition is similar to the effect of the full moon seen once a month when Earth is positioned directly between our natural satellite and the sun. Perehelia is when mars is at the point in its orbit where it is closest to the sun.\\xa0 This happens every 26 months or so, and due to Mars having an increasingly elliptical orbit the point of perihelia is becoming closer and closer to our star.\\xa0 These two events rarely overlap, and a perihelic opposition occurs only once every 15 to 17 years. Whilst the orbits are predictable to an extent, external variables such as gravitational pull surroundings moons, stars and other planets means some perihelic oppositions bring us closer to our neighbour than others.\\xa0 The orbit of the two planets are also slightly different. Mars' orbit is\\xa0more elliptical than that of Earth, so the difference between perihelion (the closest point to the sun) and aphelion (the furthest point away from the sun) is much greater, varying by around 26 million miles (43 million kilometres).\\xa0 Scientists have discovered that over many centuries, the orbit of Mars is becoming more elongated. This means the difference between perihelion and aphelion is continuously growing. This means future perihelic oppositions will bring Earth and Mars even closer.\\xa0\" => 1\n",

Twitter flagged fake accounts as those which had been dormant for at least a month.\\xa0\\xa0 Investors have previously voiced concerns the suspension of malicious accounts could could affect user growth on the platform but this was appeased when the firm's CFO announced the removal of bots and unethical accounts had not affected the company's metrics.\\xa0 The San Francisco-based company has been struggling with user growth, when compared to rivals including Instagram and Facebook. Twitter's user base is steadily shrinking, with the company losing a million monthly active users in Q2, with 335 million overall users and 68 million in the US. Twitter announced in November 2017 it would begin banning accounts affiliated with 'hate groups'. The news followed years of criticism from users that the site allowed neo-nazi, white supremacist and other extremist groups to spread abusive messages. Twitter suspended the accounts of several leaders of the far-right group Britain First in December for breaking its rules on hate speech. In March, former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson\\xa0was banned for violating rules governing 'hateful conduct'. The site announced it would soon undertake stronger measures to crack down on online trolls in May. Despite sweeping bans, the site has come under criticism for not doing enough to purge itself of abusive users. Last month, actor Seth Rogan lashed out at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for continuing to verify the accounts of white supremacists. He tweeted: 'I've been DMing with @Jack about his bizarre need to verify white supremacists on his platform for the last 8 months or so, and after all the exchanges, I’ve reached a conclusion: the dude simply does not seem to give a f**k.'\" => 1\n",

Facebook invited a dozen firms to convene at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, according to BuzzFeed News, which obtained an email detailing the meeting.\\xa0 It comes as Facebook, Google and Twitter have all taken steps this week to remove accounts believed to be linked to Iranian and Russian information operations.\\xa0 Scroll down for video\\xa0 'As I've mentioned to several of you over the last few weeks, we have been looking to schedule a follow-on discussion to our industry conversation about information operations, election protection, and the work we are all doing to tackle these challenges,' Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in the email. In addition to Facebook, representatives from Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Snapchat are all expected to be in attendance, BuzzFeed said.\\xa0 Some have expressed concerns that the meeting is being held only a few months before the midterm elections in November.\\xa0\\xa0 The meeting will be split into three parts, Gleicher explained in the email.\\xa0 First, each company will have a chance to present the work they've been doing to prevent misinformation, then attendees will discuss any problems they're facing, and finally, they'll consider whether these meetings should be held regularly.\\xa0 It's not the first time that such a meeting has occurred, however.\\xa0 In May, representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter met with Christopher Krebs, an undersecretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, and Mike Burham from the FBI's foreign influence taskforce.\\xa0 The meeting was focused around security strategies for the midterm election, but it was said to be a relatively one-sided discussion, as tech firms provided information about their activities, yet they received few details from federal intelligence officials.\\xa0 Since then, pressure has ramped up considerably for Facebook, Google and Twitter to beef up tools for preventing future misinformation campaigns.\\xa0 Each firm has reported several new meddling attempts in the course of this week alone.\\xa0 Google yesterday announced it had removed 58 accounts believed to be tied to\\xa0Iran's state broadcaster, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).\\xa0 Among the accounts Google deleted were 39 channels on YouTube that had 13,466 total US views, 13 Google+ accounts and six blogs on Blogger. Google, Twitter and Facebook have come under fire for allowing the spread of bogus news - some of which was directed by Russia - ahead of the 2016 US election and in other countries.\\xa0 In a blog post in September 2017, Facebook said that more than 3,000 advertisements posted between June 2015 and May 2017 had Russian links. These ads came from a Russian company called Internet Research Agency. According to CNN, Russia-linked Facebook ads were targeted to reach people living in Michigan and Wisconsin, both of which were won narrowly by Trump. Facebook told Congress that the apparent political meddling included use of its image-sharing application Instagram. Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch told a hearing that Instagram posts by suspect Russian accounts were seen by some 20 million Americans last year. The data on Instagram is on top of the estimated 126 million Americans exposed to Facebook posts from Russian entities seeking to create divisions during the election campaign. 'I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust,' Zuckerberg said. 'What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it.' Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg addressed criticism over allowing disinformation and manipulation during the US presidential election, just hours after the company's top lawyer faced a grilling at a Washington congressional hearing at the end of last year. 'Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well,' Zuckerberg said. 'But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.' Facebook and Twitter also shut down hundreds of accounts that were linked to Russian and Iranian misinformation campaigns.\\xa0 Facebook removed a total of 653 inauthentic pages, groups and accounts, while Twitter suspended 284 accounts linked to Iran. Still, many believe the tech giants were too slow to respond to foreign meddling attempts on their platforms.\\xa0 Facebook became a hotbed for such activity during the 2016 presidential election, when Russian 'troll factory' the Internet Research Agency used the platform to spread false information and sow discord among users.\\xa0 Earlier this year, tech executives from Twitter, Facebook and Google faced Congressional and Senate hearings to discuss how their platforms were central to foreign meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\\xa0\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"An enormous Roman villa has been uncovered beneath a field in Oxfordshire packed with trophies, including coins and boar tusks alongside a sarcophagus containing the skeletal remains of a unnamed woman. Amateur detectorist and historian Keith Westcott\\xa0found the ancient remains beneath a crop in a field near Broughton Castle near Banbury. A team of archaeologists unearthed the remains of the historic building, which is bigger than the mausoleum at the Taj Mahal, as part of a four-month excavation project.\\xa0 The foundations measure\\xa085metre by 85metre (278ft x 278ft) – the second largest ever discovered in Britain – and date back to 99 AD. The\\xa0mausoleum at the Taj Mahal is\\xa057metre x 57metre (187ft x 187ft).\\xa0 The land previously belonged to Lord and Lady Saye and Sele, the parents of Martin Fiennes, who now owns the land. He works as a principal at Oxford Sciences Innovation and is second cousin of British explorer Ranulph Fiennes and\\xa0third cousin of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The new structure is believed to be the second largest Roman villa ever found in Britain, behind only the Fishbourne Palace in West Sussex, which dates back to 75 AD was discovered in 1960. Mr Westcott, 55, decided to investigate the site after being told by local farmer John Taylor that he had ploughed his tractor into a large stone in 1963. Mr Taylor said he saw a hole had been made in the stone and when he reached inside he pulled out a human bone. Incredibly, the farmer had uncovered a sarcophagus of a high-status woman who had died in the third or fourth century. Fascinated by the story, Mr Westcott set off in October 2016 to explore the site properly. His eureka moment came when he found a 1,800 year-old tile from a hypocaust system, which was an early form of central heating used\\xa0in high-status Roman buildings. 55BC - Julius Caesar crossed the channel with around 10,000 soldiers. They landed at a beach in Deal and were met by a force of Britons. Caesar was forced to withdraw. 54BC - Caesar crossed the channel with 27,000 infantry and cavalry. Again they landed at deal but were unopposed. They marched inland and after hard battles they defeated the Britons and key tribal leaders surrendered. However, later that year, Caesar was forced to return to Gaul to deal with problems there and the Romans left. 54BC - 43BC - Although there were no Romans present in Britain during these years, their influence increased due to trade links. 43AD - A Roman force of 40,000 led by Aulus Plautius landed in Kent and took the south east. The emperor Claudius arrived in Colchester with reinforcements. Claudius appointed Plautius as Governor of Britain and returned to Rome. 47AD - Londinium (London) was founded and Britain was declared part of the Roman empire. Networks of roads were built across the country. 75 - 77AD - Romans defeated the last resistant tribes, making all Britain Roman. Many Britons started adopting Roman customs and law. 122AD - Emperor Hadrian ordered that a wall be built between England and Scotland to keep Scottish tribes out. 312AD - Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal throughout the Roman empire. 228AD - The Romans were being attacked by barbarian tribes and soldiers stationed in the country started to be recalled to Rome. 410AD - All Romans were recalled to Rome and Emperor Honorious told Britons they no longer had a connection to Rome. Source: History on the net It was then he knew that whatever ruins lay beneath the soil were of 'unimaginable quality and significance.' Along with a team from Oxford Archaeology, Mr Westcott spent two weeks on the field in April this year, digging five trial trenches to gauge the scope of the remains. Using technology such as magnotomerty\\xa0– which acts like an x-ray through soil\\xa0– walls, room outlines, ditches and other infrastructure was uncovered. The villa's accommodation would have included a bath-house with a domed roof, mosaics, a grand dining room, kitchens and a living accommodation. In total 178 items of significance were uncovered, cleaned and cataloged including coins bearing the mythological twins Romulus and Remus as well as bone china. Mr Westcott, who is director of The Association of Detectorists, said: 'It truly is a remarkable find of incredible historical significance. 'We've only uncovered about one per cent so the possibilities of what we still might find are endless. 'The only bigger one is at Fishbourne Palace in West Sussex\\xa0– but that is a palace and we think that parts of it could date back to the second century. 'All other sites of this significance\\xa0– with the exception of North Leigh near Witney\\xa0– have a visitor centre and/or a museum, so it really is a big deal.' He says that it is possible Roman dignitaries visited for the sporting purposes.\\xa0 'Most of the other big courtyard villas were discovered in the 1800s and excavated using Victorian techniques', said Mr Westcott. 'All of the other discoveries had been done so by accident but in this instance I had a theory and went with it. 'The villa would be the real centre of rural industry and agriculture and although the persons living there would have been very wealthy and powerful there would have been all sorts of things going on from the cooks to slaves.\\xa0 'The more we're finding out about this part of north Oxfordshire, we're realizing at the head of the triangle between Fosse Way, Akeman Street and Watling Street was a very important Roman area', he said.\\xa0 Unlike many other sites, this one has nothing built on top.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Universities, English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Roman archaeology are now being approached to take part in a full excavation. The cost of the project could be in the region of around two million pounds. Martin Fiennes, who was also central to the operation and took part in the dig, said: 'The next step will be for me to reach out to various universities, starting with Oxford, to see if they are interested in leading a project to do a full excavation over a period of years. 'Obviously we would like someone to do it who can involve the local community as much as possible as well as comprehensively recording the site. 'If no-one wants to do it, then it stays happily undisturbed for another 50 or 100 years until someone comes up with the money and interest.' \\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"There\\xa0was moment, in the early stages of the second half, when Brighton had a throw-in just by Liverpool's technical area. Four red shirts lined up to ensure all avenues that Brighton wanted to exploit remained closed, but for all that Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Gini Wijnaldum were in close attendance, Jurgen Klopp only wanted to talk to one man – James Milner. As Klopp barked away, waving his hands and remonstrating, his captain fired a look back that simply said everything was in hand. This was no isolated incident. For the vast majority of the game, Milner was the one player Liverpool's manager sought out. It was not difficult to understand why. Among the relentlessly positive narratives that have come out of Anfield in the early stages of this campaign, few are more deserving of praise than the evergreen Milner; his fingerprints are all over this opening flurry of three consecutive wins. Klopp suggested during his pre-match media conference that Milner had the capacity to play until he is '36, 37, even 38' and to watch him at work here, scurrying from one side of the pitch to the other, you appreciated this was not an observation made on a whim. Milner was everywhere, never more so than in the 23rd minute when he pounced out of the shadows to rob Yves Bissouma and set the wheels in motion on an attack that ended with Mohamed Salah decisively steering a shot beyond the impressive Mat Ryan. Brighton had been organised and resilient in the opening stages; their defence was well drilled and they showed no sign of giving Liverpool the spaces they love to attack and it might have stayed that way had Milner not set upon Bissouma. This was him making the difference, just as he had done when he was man-of-the-match on the opening weekend against West Ham, and when firing in from the penalty spot to give Liverpool a lead they never relinquished at Crystal Palace last Monday. He was the best player on the pitch here, too. Just before he mugged Bissouma, Milner had shown the full repertoire of his passing, driving one ball 60 yards, from right to left, into the feet of Andrew Robertson; another fine ball almost created a chance for Wijnaldum. Grabbing headlines with spectacular moments has never been in Milner's way but his input into this victory could not be understated. Liverpool, you could suggest, were off colour as an attacking force and the victory owed everything to their graft and desire to keep a clean sheet. Nobody embodied the determination more than Milner, whose influence could be measured by the fact he came in for some heavy treatment from Brighton in the second half, notably when Bissouma clattered into him to earn a yellow card. They couldn't knock him out of his stride, however, and in the 80th minute, when he went to get an energy gel and some water, Klopp again beckoned Milner over to impart his final instructions to ensure Liverpool got over the line. At the final whistle, Milner turned and screamed 'YES!' towards the Main Stand, his delight evident at a job well done. Quickly, though, he had turned on his heels and was heading down the tunnel, already thinking about the next test. If Liverpool are going to go the distance this year, their running man Milner will be central to the plot.\" => 0\n",

      "\"A hypnotic new animation has revealed the journey of the continents over 540 million years, as huge landmasses drifted around the globe before settling into the positions we know today. The animation, shared on Twitter by climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, traces Earth’s history with shifting green blobs overlaid on outlines of the current continents. It shows just how dramatically the face of our planet has changed over the course of millions of years. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The map shared by Schmidt was created using data from the recently published\\xa0paleoDEM – a ‘digital representation of paleotopography and paleobathymetry that has been “reconstructed” back in time,’ according to the authors. This takes into account the changes in the oceans, lowlands, and mountainous regions over 540 million years of Earth’s history. There are many mysteries about what the earliest days of Earth’s continents were like. While it’s speculated that a huge landmass known as Vaalbara may have emerged as the first supercontinent 3.6 billion years ago, a smaller supercontinent called Ur, which formed around three billion years ago, is considered to be the earliest known. Over the next few billion years of tectonic activity, over a dozen supercontinents formed, the most famous being Pangaea, which started to break apart roughly 175 million years ago. The animation captures a relatively recent period of Earth’s tectonic history. It begins just over 540 million years ago, showing huge landmasses that spread across areas now covered by the Pacific Ocean, with three smaller continents already broken off on their own. Tectonic plates are composed of Earth's crust and the uppermost portion of the mantle.\\xa0 Below is the asthenosphere: the warm, viscous conveyor belt of rock on which tectonic plates ride. Earthquakes typically occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates, where one plate dips below another, thrusts another upward, or where plate edges scrape alongside each other.\\xa0 Earthquakes rarely occur in the middle of plates, but they can happen when ancient faults or rifts far below the surface reactivate.\\xa0 These areas are relatively weak compared to the surrounding plate, and can easily slip and cause an earthquake. As time passes, the entirety can be seen crunching closer together, pushing toward the center – or the Atlantic Ocean. These landmasses drift further north over millions of years, to stretch like a columnar blob from the South to North Pole. Then, about 150 million years ago, the animation shows how the separate components of this large mass began to drift away from the center, breaking apart to be several different formations. Eventually, these separate pieces drift into the outlines of today’s continent, fitting into their familiar places starting about 10 million years ago, the animation shows.\" => 1\n",

      "\"An enormous new telescope aims to finally solve a mystery surrounding cryptic signals that pelt Earth every day from unknown sources across deep space. The £3.8 million ($4.9 million) Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) project is being built to explore 'Fast Radio Bursts' or FRBs. These rapid and bright signals appear temporarily and randomly, making them tricky to find and study – with just 20 signals ever detected since their discovery in 2001. However, using the new HIRAX telescope, scientists hope to scan as many as 12 FRBs per day in an attempt to shed light on the origins of the elusive radio emissions. HIRAX's instruments will be more likely to catch FRBs as they flash across the sky because of large proportion of the sky that can be observed with its instruments. Experts speculate FRBs could originate from a number of sources, with possible explanations including advanced extra-terrestrial civilisations and debris created by exploding black holes.\\xa0 Scientists hope the HIRAX project – an array of 1,000 six-metre-wide (20ft) satellite dishes spread across two sites in the southern hemisphere – will provide answers. The dishes will combine to form an interferometer array, which combines signals from many telescopes to provide the resolution of a much larger telescope. Researchers have already built four test dishes at a site Karoo, South Africa, and a further three have been built at a site in Western Australia. HIRAX will probe the characteristics of the universe’s dark energy 7 billion to 11 billion years ago. To do this, it will\\xa0operate between 400 and 800 MHz in order to map the neutral hydrogen in the universe. Neutral hydrogen gas, which scientists believe is directly proportional to the amount of dark matter found in galaxies,\\xa0emits a signal at 1420 MHz – around the same frequency as mobile phones and television channels. However, this signal gets stretched to lower frequencies as the universe expands. By operating at a lower\\xa0400 and 800 MHz, scientists should be able to\\xa0map neutral hydrogen in the universe from around seven to 11 billion years ago. Dark energy is a phrase used by physicists to describe a mysterious 'something' that is causing unusual things to take place in the universe.\\xa0 Researchers hope the telescope will also be able to locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in their host galaxies for the first time. The team will look for FRBs, which will be easier to spot using\\xa0HIRAX in part because of its exceptionally wide field of view. Part of what makes the bursts so hard to catch is that they're so brief, and most telescopes only observe a very small portion of the sky at any given moment. Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are radio emissions that appear temporarily and randomly, making them not only hard to find, but also hard to study. The mystery stems from the fact it is not known what could produce such a short and sharp burst. This has led some to speculate they could be anything from stars colliding to artificially created messages. The first FRB was spotted, or rather 'heard' by radio telescopes, back in 2001 but wasn't discovered until 2007 when scientists were analysing archival data. But it was so temporary and seemingly random that it took years for astronomers to agree it wasn't a glitch in one of the telescope's instruments.\\xa0 Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics point out that FRBs can be used to study the structure and evolution of the universe whether or not their origin is fully understood. A large population of faraway FRBs could act as probes of material across gigantic distances.\\xa0 This intervening material blurs the signal from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the left over radiation from the Big Bang.\\xa0 A careful study of this intervening material should give an improved understanding of basic cosmic constituents, such as the relative amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy, which affect how rapidly the universe is expanding. FRBs can also be used to trace what broke down the 'fog' of hydrogen atoms that pervaded the early universe into free electrons and protons, when temperatures cooled down after the Big Bang.\\xa0 HIRAX's wide field of view will be more likely to catch FRBs as they flash across the sky daily, with researchers expecting to read up to a dozen signals per day. The telescope will boast the unique capability of being able to figure out exactly where in the sky these fast radio bursts occur, by working with several other Southern African countries to build 8-dish outrigger arrays. Combined with the main array, this system will help scientists pinpoint where the bursts came from in their host galaxies. To pinpoint the exact location, HIRAX will have to record, store and analyse a swathe of information, predicted to hit around 6.5 Terabits per second at its peak. Full construction on HIRAX will begin next year in the Karoo desert, with the array initially comprising 128 dish-like elements. This group will be expanded to 1,024 dishes by 2020. The experiment is being managed by South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and is the result of a large global collaboration. 'This radio-astronomy telescope aims to describe the effects of dark energy on the distribution of galaxies,'\\xa0UKZN principal Dr Albert van Jaarsveld said. 'The project is led from UKZN by a dynamic young team of astronomers that are breaking new ground and leveraging the SKA investment to grow a new generation of young astronomers in KZN and South Africa.'\\xa0 Mysterious signals coming from distant galaxies could be evidence of deep-space explorers billions of light-years from Earth, a recent study has claimed. Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in March 2017 claimed a solar-powered transmitter using sunlight cast on an area twice the size of Earth could generate enough energy to be 'seen' by far away viewers. And, a water-cooling system would allow a device of this size to withstand the extreme heat. The researchers argue that the most plausible use for this tremendous amount of power would be to drive interstellar light sails. The light sail would rely on a steady beam from the transmitter. While this would always be pointed at the sail, observers on Earth would see it as a brief flash, as the sail, its host planet, its star, and the galaxy all move relative to us. This would cause the beam to sweep across the sky, only pointing at Earth for a moment.\" => 1\n",

      "\"For a few fleeting moments, the iPhone 8 was the flagship of the range, the best phone Apple has ever made. However, just\\xa0moments after its introduction at the Steve Jobs Theater last week, Tim Cook revealed the iPhone X, with its futuristic looks and claim to be 'the future of the iPhone'. But don't be fooled -  for many the iPhone 8 will be the perfect handset, the 'iPhone classic' of the range, and a phone you really shouldn't write off. Scroll down for video\\xa0 In fact, it’s got pretty much the the same internals as the X, but with the more familiar screen (and fingerprint sensor). It’s all about options - and the iPhone 8 is a really great one, an ‘iPhone classic’, if you will. While from the front, the phone looks absolutely identical to the 7 series, once you pick it up, the huge number of changes Apple has made become apparent. First, there’s the new glass back, which is on both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. While looking lovely (especially in the gold colour, which is actually far more similar to Apple’s old rose gold), it also allows for wireless charging. It is also far grippier than the iPhone 7, and really does feel far more secure and solid in the hand.\\xa0 The iPhone 8 does feels heavier, in both ‘normal’ and plus versions, but is definitely more noticeable in the plus. The screen has also got a boost, and in particular the new True Tone technology, which was previously on the iPad, makes a big difference.\\xa0 It uses a four-channel ambient light sensor to automatically adjust white balance to match the light around you for a better viewing experience, and mean colours always look as they should.\\xa0 The speakers are also 25% better, making the iPhone 8 a surprisingly decent portable speaker. Charging the 8 is a revelation - and gives users options for the first time. There’s the standard lightning port charging, but also a new fast charge that takes the handset from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes - although be warned you’ll need a USB-C charger and lightning cable, which aren’t included. The wireless charging, however, is what most people will use - and it’s great.\\xa0 We tried the $60 Belkin BoostUp  charging disc, and it works brilliantly - with a few small caveats. First, you do need to be careful to place the phone in the center of the charger, or you can accidentally think its charging when it’s not.\\xa0 However, this is a mistake you’ll probably only make once to be honest.\\xa0 Secondly, the wireless charging is a little slower than using a lightning cable. However, the convenience more than outweighs this - it’s a fantastic experience to just pop your phone on the disc on your bedside table at night rather than looking for the cable that’s fallen under the bed. Apple also says an update later this year will improve speed. Expect to see wireless chargers popping up everywhere - the iPhone 8 works with Qi chargers that are available as in cars, cafés, hotels, airports, and furniture, with Ikea in particular having a great range. In terms of battery life, it’s almost identical to the iPhone 7.  Both the Phone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus feature an improved 12MP camera with a larger and faster sensor, a new colour filter and deeper pixels.\\xa0 Apple has overhauled the processing of pictures, and it shows with faster autofocus in low light and better HDR photos.\\xa0 Sunsets pictures in particular look better than ever before. For the plus, this all adds up to the best camera ever seen on a phone - particularly with the improved portrait modes that allow you to use depth effect and a new lighting feature.\\xa0 This lets you see the effects in real time as you’re you’re taking the pic - or to edit the effects after taking the photo. There’s also no lag between pressing the shutter button and the picture appearing on screen. Video has also got a boost, with better video stabilisation, 4K video up to 60fps and 1080p slo-mo up to 240 fps. The key thing about the iPhone 8 is that it’s fast - really, really fast.\\xa0 The new A11 bionic processor, the same one that’s in the iPhone X, has a six-core CPU design, and a three-core GPU optimized for 3D games and AR experiences, the first Apple has designed itself.\\xa0 The new six-core design features 4.3 billion transistors, and two performance cores are up to 25 percent faster than the CPU performance cores in the A10 Fusion chip, while four high-efficiency cores are up to 70 percent faster.\\xa0 The CPU can even harness all six cores simultaneously when you need a boost in power.\\xa0 In short - it’s quick - and will mean game graphics and, most importantly for Apple, AR apps, run incredible smoothly.\\xa0\\xa0 It's impossible to talk about the iPhone 8 without mentioning the iPhone X. But in fact, the 8 actually has several advantages over the X - not least that it's available from Friday. It's got a design that looks superb, particularly the new gold, and the wireless charging really does change the way you use your phone. Overall, while the iPhone 8 is perhaps not the revolution the the X is, externally at least, in reality this is a huge upgrade from the 7 - and shows that Apple now has a range with the perfect handset for everyone.\\xa0 Apple's Augmented reality system uses the cameras on an iPhone to detect a flat surface, or 'plane' to put the virtual objects on, such as a table or floor. With a combination of machine learning and the camera data, it can constantly adjust the image so the object appears secured to the correct surface without the 'jitters' or other AR systems. ARKit also makes use of the camera sensor to estimate the total amount of light available in a scene and applies the correct amount of lighting to virtual objects. In \\xa0practise, it's hugely impressive - also wandering around the room 'looking through' your phone does take a bit of getting used to.\\xa0 Ikea's first AR app, called Ikea Place, lets you put any item, from\\xa0sofas and lamps, to rugs and tables into your living room to see how they look. It sounds like a gimmick, but in practice its astonishingly good. 'The app lets you virtually 'place' home products that are 3-D and true to-scale so you can make sure they're just the right size, design and functionality for your room,' Ikea says, and it really works. A sofa placed into the room we were sitting in appeared at the perfect size, on the floor just as it should be.\\xa0 You're able to walk right up to it to see the fabric up close, and even look underneath. It's also possible to see several version of the same item - for instance, in one demonstration we saw a sofa bed as both sofa and bed. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\" => 1\n",

The container vessel, dubbed\\xa0Venta Maersk, will travel between the cities of St Petersburg and Vladivostok over the top of Russia. Experts say it could reduce the most commonly used East Asia-Europe route via the Suez Canal from 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometres) to 8,000 miles (12,800 kilometres), cutting transit time by 10-15 days. Typically vessels taking this icy route have required an ice-breaker escort, but rising global temperatures are making the passage easier to traverse. It was first navigated by Finnish explorer\\xa0Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1879. Scroll down for video Industry experts believe Maersk's trip could mark tipping point for shipping and the Arctic. Malte Humpert, founder and senior fellow of the Arctic Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, told NPR:\\xa0'It's not a major, dramatic shift, it's just a kind of sequential development. 'The ice is melting and more things are becoming possible in the Arctic, and with that, of course ... comes enhanced risk for the environment.'\\xa0 Janina von Spalding, spokesperson for\\xa0Maersk, said its new ice class container vessel would embark on a trial journey in the Arctic route over Russia next month. It will leave Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok around September 1 with a cargo of frozen fish and sail to St. Petersburg where it will arrive by the end of the month. 'In today's fast-paced world, companies that want to lead must innovate,' Ms\\xa0von Spalding said. The trial 'will offer us a unique opportunity to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems, crew capabilities and the functionality of the shore based support setup,' she added. 'I think it is important to underline that this is a one-off trial designed to explore an unknown route for container shipping and to collect scientific data - and not the launch of a new product,' she said. The Northern Sea Route could be a shorter route for journeys from East Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada. This is because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change. The transit route was coordinated with Russian authorities after careful evaluation of ice conditions. The Northeast Passage was first proposed as a trade route as early as the 11th Century. Russian sailors hoped the route could provide a quick way to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but few got very far. It wasn't until\\xa01878-79 that Finnish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld\\xa0made the first complete passage of the Northeast Passage.\\xa0 The Arctic route is laced with thick sea ice, even in the summer months, making it a treacherous place to sail even today. Even the largest of container ships need a reinforced hull to break through the region's ice, and most must be led by specialised ice-breaker vessels. But experts suggest that the effects of global warming could soften the route and make it easier for ships to pass through. Ice breaker assistance will be at hand throughout the route, the Copenhagen-based group said. 'Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea Route as a commercial alternative to our existing network which is defined by our customers' demand, trading patterns and population centers,'\\xa0von Spalding added.

      "\"Jose Mourinho proclaimed himself 'a club man' who has never been selfish in his career as he faced up to an escalating crisis at Manchester United. The problems surrounding Mourinho that have spilled over from a difficult summer on tour and in the transfer market are in danger of overshadowing United's start to the season. An unconvincing opening win at home to Leicester was followed by a surprise defeat at Brighton last weekend, and Mourinho is a manager under pressure going into Monday's crucial game against Tottenham at Old Trafford. Another setback this early in the season would inevitably turn up the heat on the 55-year-old and his executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has not escaped the flak for the issues affecting the club. Crucially, the fans have yet to turn on Mourinho, even though some have paid to fly a protest banner against Woodward over Turf Moor when United play at Burnley on Sunday. The manager welcomed their support, but insisted it was for the sake of the team, not for himself. That may come as a surprise to those who have followed his career closely as well as the recent events at Old Trafford. Mourinho has certainly not been afraid of publicising his differences with Woodward and his awkward relationships with Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial. 'The supporters were fantastic in both matches,' he said. 'Not for me, for the team which is the only thing that matters. In my career I was never selfish and thinking about myself, I was always a club man. That's what I am. I am really happy when the supporters support the team. 'For fans to be supportive of the team against Brighton, when we didn't play well and lost the match, gives you a fantastic feeling. The players also feel it and they are ready to give them everything they have.' In other respects, Mourinho maintained his moody demeanour in the build-up to what has become an even more significant game against Spurs. A press conference lasting just three minutes and 22 seconds was shorter even than his tetchy four-minute exchange with the broadcast media. He refused to discuss Tottenham's decision not to sign any new players this summer or his feelings about the state of United's squad after £75m of investment — 'you know my answer' was the curt response — perhaps wary of the potentially unfavourable comparison. Mourinho's only other answer of note came when he was asked if it was frustrating to do so well against top-six rivals last season but drop points against lesser clubs. 'No, it is not a frustration,' he said. 'It would also be a frustration if we won every match against the non top-six teams and didn't win against the top six. 'We want to win all the time. We want to play well all the time. We don't want to make mistakes. That is what you always want.'\" => 0\n",

Over a dozen of the hunger stones, chosen to record low water levels, can now be seen in and near the northern Czech town of Decin near the German border. The low water levels in the river that begins in the Czech Republic then crosses Germany into the North Sea has exposed stones on the river bed whose appearances in history used to warn people that hard times were coming. The oldest water mark visible on the river dates to 1616.\\xa0 That stone, is considered the oldest hydrological landmark in Central Europe, bears a chiseled inscription in German that says: 'When you see me, cry.' On other rivers,  hunger stones go back to the 15th century, and inscriptions from 1417, 1473, 1616, 1654 and 1666 have been found.\\xa0 In the second half of the 19th century, they entered the general consciousness after mentions in newspapers. One of the earliest recording mentions was on 30 August 1876, when the Teplitzer Zeitung wrote: 'The Elbe offers as a result of the prolonged drought, a sad sight, as he has not occurred since 1842: everywhere stand out the hunger stones and the meter level at the bridge over the Elbe is not from the water more touched. The Elbe stone was first spotted in  1918, and became exposed during a period of low water coincident to the wartime famines of World War I. also known in German as 'Hungerstein', previous research linked them to periods of drought. The extremely low water level of the Elbe currently allows so-called 'Hungersteine' to be recorded in the Saxon part of the river.\\xa0 'Hungersteine' are striking rock formations, stones or plates in rivers, which are only visible at particularly low water levels and bear dates or inscriptions.\" => 1\n",

Diamond is seeking two or three more forwards and the club are plotting to achieve their first play-off finish since 2006. \\'It\\'s my eighth year here and Brian Kennedy was owner for six of those years,\\' Diamond told Sportsmail. \\'With Brian losing a little bit of desire it became a damage limitation job, but now we\\'re expanding our horizons. \\'I\\'ve got a lot of experience of operating with no money, but now my job is about operating with a little bit more and challenging these top teams.

You\\'ve got Exeter and Saracens above everyone else, but then others will battle it out and having local lads like Ben and Tom goes a long, long way.\\' While Tom is the current holder of England\\'s No 7 jersey, their statistics are on par. They have emerged as the leading turnover specialists in England at the breakdown, with their skills coming back into fashion during the Six Nations.\\xa0 Tom, who has had to adapt to changes in refereeing interpretations, explains: \\'The year before last, you could tackle, stand up and just pick up the ball up for a turnover. This time last year, a referee came in and talked about getting quick ball from the ruck. They basically said: \"Get out the way, we don\\'t want to see any contest\", which meant fewer turnovers. \\'Then, when England got smashed at the breakdown during this year\\'s Six Nations, all of the media said that English refs are destroying the breakdown for us internationally because of the way it\\'s refereed.

      "\"Ian Poulter and Paul Casey will both need wildcards if they are to play for Europe in the Ryder Cup in Paris next month.\\xa0 Their final chance to make the team by right came and went when both finished down the field in the first of the FedEx Cup play-off events on the PGA Tour. Both needed a minimum of a top-20 finish in the Northern Trust to displace Thorbjorn Olesen in the last automatic spot, but neither came close after final rounds of 69 for Poulter and 74 for Casey. In theory, they could make a late dash and play in the Made in Denmark tournament this week, which is the final qualifying event. In reality, both will be in Boston for the second FedEx play-off tournament, which does not count. That event, however, will be completed before captain Thomas Bjorn names his four wildcards on September 5, so Poulter and Casey will have one final chance to impress, as will two more on the outside looking in — Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Swede Henrik Stenson. In truth, it is hard to imagine Poulter will not get one after his excellent season, but with Sergio Garcia and in-form Thomas Pieters also in need of a wildcard, Bjorn must be thankful he insisted on an extra pick. The only danger man Olesen will have to worry about on home soil this week, therefore, is Matt Fitzpatrick, who would need to win the Danish event to have a chance. Meanwhile, at the Czech Masters, Padraig Harrington came up short in his remarkable attempt to turn a disastrous season into a victorious one. Without so much as a top-25 finish all season and with more missed cuts in 19 events than paydays, the 46-year-old Irishman appeared to be playing mainly so he could wear his Ryder Cup vice-captain's hat and run the rule over Pieters, his playing partner for the first two days. But while the Belgian had to be satisfied with scraping into the top 10, Harrington was involved in a compelling duel for the title with Italian Andrea Pavan. Harrington did little wrong as he built a three-shot lead, only for Pavan to come storming home in 31 shots for a three-shot victory. It was the 29-year-old's maiden success. 'All credit to Andrea, it was definitely a tournament he won rather than one I gave away,' said Harrington. The turning point was the 16th, where Pavan holed from 40ft for a birdie, taking the lead for the first time after Harrington missed for a birdie of his own. At the Northern Trust, golfing scientist Bryson DeChambeau had all the solutions early in the final round as he established a commanding six-shot lead.\\xa0 Already heavily fancied for a Ryder Cup wildcard — he finished one spot outside the automatic places — the 24-year-old Californian was moving towards the victory that would make him a certainty to be chosen alongside Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\\xa0\" => 0\n",

      "\"Sections of Arctic soil are no longer freezing over all year round, threatening to pump thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Scientists found that soil in one of the world's coldest regions remained mushy and damp throughout the most recent winter. During these months the soil normally freezes over, forming a protective layer over Arctic permafrost that houses billions of tonnes of ancient carbon. Scientists warned that without this insulation, the permafrost will begin to melt, potentially releasing a dangerous payload of carbon dioxide and methane. Scroll down for video\\xa0 Russian scientist Dr Nikita Zimov sent a team to drill into the top layer of soil at Cherskiy, Russia, in April. The small town in Northern Siberia is one of the coldest places on Earth, with average winter temperatures as low as -34°C (-29°F). His team found that the top layer of soil at Cherskiy - one of the coldest places on Earth - failed to freeze over during winter, instead remaining soft and moist. The ground below the surface there should be frozen solid even in late spring,\\xa0Dr Zimov told\\xa0National Geographic. The scientist runs Russia's Pleistocene Park project, which aims to recreate an ice age ecosystem in a remote region of northern Siberia to boost wildlife numbers.\\xa0 Assuming this same process is occurring across warmer parts of the Arctic Circle, much of the polar region's permafrost could be at risk of accelerated thawing. Every winter across the Arctic, the top few inches or feet of soil and rich plant matter freezes up before thawing again in summer. Beneath this active layer sits continuously frozen earth called permafrost, which extends hundreds of feet down and, in places, has remained frozen for millennia. Without a protective layer of soil, permafrost across the Arctic could melt for the first time in thousands of years, scientists warned. Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer below the Earth's surface found in Arctic regions such as Alaska, Siberia and Canada. It typically consists of soil, gravel and sand bound together by ice, and is classified as ground that has remained below 0°C (32°F) for at least two years. It is estimated 1,500 billion tons of carbon is stored in the world's permafrost - more than twice the amount found in the atmosphere. The carbon comes in the form of ancient vegetation and soil that has remained frozen for millennia. If global warming were to melt the world's permafrost, it could release thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.\\xa0 Because some permafrost regions have stayed frozen for thousands of years, it is of particular interest for scientists. Ancient remains found in permafrost are among the most complete ever found because the ice stops organic matter from decomposing. A number of 2,500-year-old bodies buried in Siberia by a group of nomads known as the Scythians have been found with their tattooed skin still intact. A baby mammoth corpse uncovered on Russia's Arctic coast in 2010 still sported clumps of its hair despite being more than 39,000 years old. Permafrost is also used in the study of Earth's geological history as soil and minerals buried deep in Arctic regions for thousands of years can be dug up and studied today. 'This is a big deal,' Professor Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University, said. 'In the permafrost world, this is a significant milestone in a disturbing trend - like carbon in the atmosphere reaching 400 parts per million.' Permafrost is found beneath nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere's landmass. Trapped in this frozen soil and vegetation is around 1,500 billion tons of carbon - more than twice the amount found in the atmosphere. If global warming continues to thaw Arctic permafrost, it could allow microbes to eat the organic matter stored in it, releasing carbon dioxide and methane.\\xa0 This threatens to create a deadly feedback loop in which global warming releases more greenhouse gases from permafrost, which in turns heats up the planet. Scientists have previously estimated that permafrost in the Arctic holds the potential to release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the air.\\xa0 At a site just 11 miles (18km) from Dr Zimov's drilling, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Germany measure carbon exchange between the Earth and atmosphere. Researcher Dr Mathias Goeckede told National Geographic\\xa0snow depth there has doubled over the past five years. When deep snow covers the ground, it insulates the top layer of soil and stops warmth beneath the surface from dissipating during winter. Data from a drill hole on Dr Goeckede's site show temperatures 13 inches (30cm) below ground rose by about 6 degrees Celsius between 2013 and 2018. 'This is just one site, and it's just five years, so this really should be considered just a case-study,' Dr Goeckede said. 'But if you assume it's a trend or that it might continue like this, then it's alarming.' Other scientists warned that Arctic permafrost remains exposed by melted soil for increasingly lengthy periods.\\xa0 Vladimir Romanovsky, permafrost expert at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said: 'For all years before 2014, the complete freeze-up of the active layer would happen in mid-January. 'Since 2014, the freeze-up date has shifted to late February and even March.'\\xa0\" => 1\n",

      "\"Humans aren’t the only ones that blush when they get excited. Scientists have discovered that blue-and-yellow macaws ruffle their head feathers and even turn pink in the face in certain social situations. While it’s still a mystery what exactly they’re trying to communicate with these gestures, the experts suspect it’s a sign of positive interaction. Scroll down for video\\xa0 The blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) is a type of parrot known for their intelligence and verbal skills. In a new study, researchers observed five hand-reared captive macaws as they interacted with each other and with their human caretakers. The team focused on the birds’ feather position (ruffled or sleeked) on the crown, nape, and cheek. They also looked for signs of blushing on their cheeks, where the skin is bare. During the interactions, the researchers noticed several differences in their visual cues. Feather ruffling, for example, was more common when the birds were not in motion. This could be seen during resting periods and in social interactions. And, the birds were more likely to ruffle their crown feathers or blush when the human caretaker was actively interacting with them. According to the researchers, this suggests the behaviors are associated with positive social interactions. ‘How birds use facial displays and whether they communicate their inner subjective feelings is a question that is crucial to deepening our understanding of bird sentience,’ according to the authors. ‘Although caution must be exercised when interpreting these data due to the small sample size, we argue that crown ruffling and skin color variation may provide facial indicators of birds’ inner subjective feelings. Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A recent study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved. Researchers believe this may be partly because island birds face less competition to be heard. Whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others. ‘On a practical level, parrots are popular companion animals, with millions of parrots being kept as pets, and understanding visual communication in parrots may help to assess their well-being in captive conditions.’ Though there’s still much to be learned about the meaning behind their behaviors, the findings suggest macaws may have some similarities to humans when it comes to visual communications. ‘Blushing may not be a characteristic unique to humans: the featherless cheek of the blue-and-yellow macaw parrot reveals rapid color changes in situations associated with emotion,’ Bertin said. ‘The macaw’s particularly complex face may enable communication via color and feather displays.’ \\xa0\" => 1\n",
