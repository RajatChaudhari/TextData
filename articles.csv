"No wonder Jose Mourinho is worried about the start of the new season. Four days to go until it kicks off at Old Trafford and he is still waiting for the real Manchester United to turn up. This has been a strange, disjointed few weeks for Mourinho and his players, and it showed as they completed their pre-season on a muggy night in Munich. On this evidence, whatever team United put out on Friday night will struggle to overcome Leicester never mind challenge Manchester City's dominance of the Premier League. BAYERN MUNICH (3-4-3): Neuer; Kimmich (Rudy 72), Sule, Hummels (Boateng 46), Alaba (Bernat 56); Martinez; Robben, Muller, Thiago (Rafinha 60), Ribery; Gnabry. Subs: Ulreich, Hoffmann, Lewandowski, Boateng, Goretzka, Coman, Mai, Zylla, Franzke. Booked: Boateng Scorer: Martinez 59 MAN UTD (4-3-3): De Gea (Grant 78); Darmian (Jones 65), Bailly (Smalling 51), Lindelof (Tuanzebe 78), Shaw (Mitchell 78); Herrera (Garner 81), Pereira, Fred (Chong 78); Mata (McTominay 65), Rashford (Fosu-Mensah 65), Sanchez.  Subs: Greenwood. Referee: Robert Hartmann After City gave another demonstration of what they can do at Wembley, United looked every bit a team that is coming together in drips and drabs. Marcus Rashford returned for more than an hour here, officially inheriting the No.10 shirt vacated by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while Phil Jones and Victor Lindelof also played for the first time since the World Cup. But there was still no Paul Pogba, no Romelu Lukaku, no Jesse Lingard, no Ashley Young and no Marouane Fellaini. Nemanja Matic and Antonio Valencia are injured. Anthony Martial and Marcos Rojo were left at home when United flew to Germany, casting further doubt over their futures at Old Trafford, and Eric Bailly limped off early in the second half. A new centre-half remains the priority and Mourinho is banking on United chief Ed Woodward delivering one. United were reported to have stepped up their interest in Harry Maguire with a £75million bid on Sunday night as Leicester continue to resist. It's understood that Jerome Boateng – a half-time substitute for Bayern here – is emerging as another strong possibility even though he would cost £50m and turns 30 next month. Asked about Boateng, Mourinho said: 'My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens.' Otherwise, the United boss is preparing to make the most out of the players he has available against Leicester. 'We were unlucky to get the Friday game so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is not enough,' he added. 'We have to organise the week in a way that we can arrive fresh for Friday because Friday starts the Premier League and we play for points and Friday is the players we have. 'There is no time to cry for the players that are not going to be. On Friday we go with the best possible team.' United look anything but the finished article and it's hard to see how they can click into gear in four days after such a fragmented preparation. They were under the cosh throughout here and David de Gea made first half saves from Thiago Alcantara and Serge Gnabry. However, he was beaten in the 59th minute when Javi Martinez rose to score with a glancing header from Thiago's corner, a timely reminder perhaps of United's need for an upgrade in central defence. Manuel Neuer did not have a single save to make and Mourinho ended the game by sending on the kids and third-choice keeper Lee Grant. Maybe it was a message to Woodward. Their strained relationship could deteriorate even further if there isn't a new addition through the door by 5pm on Thursday. Peter Kenyon, the former United and Chelsea chief executive who played a key role in Mourinho's appointment at Stamford Bridge in 2004, has been there before and claimed on Sunday that the 55-year-old Portuguese coach can still make it work. But he warned: 'United is bigger than anybody, bigger than any individual and that's always been the mantra.' "
"Everton have agreed a £28.4million fee for Barcelona defender Yerry Mina after his talks with Manchester United stalled. Mina had been heavily linked with a switch to United, who are eager to bring in another centre-back. However, the Colombia international is instead edging towards joining Everton, where he would become the fourth arrival at Goodison Park in this transfer window following the signings of Richarlison, Joao Virginia and Mina's former Barcelona team-mate Lucas Digne. Mina only joined Barcelona in January, but was restricted to just six appearances to the club, although he did win the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey. The 23-year-old impressed for Colombia at the World Cup and could be a hugely important player for Marco Silva's side this campaign.  Everton get their Premier League season underway on Saturday when they travel to face newly-promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Following that the Toffees, who finished eighth last season, will host Southampton.  Richarlison - Watford - £35.28million Lucas Digne - Barcelona - £18.18million Joao Virginia - Arsenal - Undisclosed"
"Manchester United have held talks with Bayern Munich over a proposed deal for Jerome Boateng. Sportsmail reported last week that the 29-year-old had been offered to United after his move to Paris Saint-Germain fell through. Bayern are prepared to accept around £45million for former Manchester City defender Boateng, who turns 30 next month, but United want to drive the price lower. A new centre-half remains the priority and Mourinho is banking on United chief Ed Woodward delivering one. Boateng — a half-time substitute for Bayern on Sunday night — has emerged as a serious alternative to Harry Maguire who is being priced out of a move by Leicester. Talks are understood to have taken place between United and their German hosts on Sunday night over Boateng. United would want to reduce that fee of £45m to nearer £40m. Asked about Boateng, Mourinho emphasised the need for United chief Ed Woodward to make a new signing. 'The other clubs that compete with us are really strong or they have already fantastic squads like Chelsea, Spurs, City, or they are investing massively like for example Liverpool buying everything and everybody,' said Mourinho. 'If we don't make our team better it will be a difficult season for us. 'My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens.  United have yet to bid for Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld and have grown frustrated in their pursuit of Barcelona's Yerry Mina. Everton have since agreed a £28.4m fee for the Colombian - though the deal is still to go through.  "
"When Gareth Southgate officially returns to work on Monday morning, the video of Phil Foden's Wembley performance will offer him the perfect antidote to those holiday blues. Gushing with poise and maturity beyond his 18 years, Foden strode around the hallowed turf like he'd been playing there for years. If all goes according plan, Wembley will become a second home for this supremely talented central midfielder. Southgate is convinced Foden can be the lynchpin of England's engine room for years to come; judging by his work in the Community Shield he's spot on. England's unforgettable run to the World Cup semi-final was unforgettable - but it's in the past. Southgate will reiterate that message when he reports for duty on Monday. The future is Euro 2020 and beyond; the England manager believes Foden will be key to that future being a successful one. So too could Callum Hudson-Odoi, who provided promising glimpses of why he's being labelled as the best of Chelsea's emerging academy talent on Sunday. Foden and Hudson-Odoi were the heartbeat of England's Under 17 World Cup winning side in India last year. On Sunday, Foden looked better equipped to take the final step into senior football. His piercing run through the heart of Chelsea's defence before assisting Sergio Aguero to put Manchester City ahead was unerring. The way he lured David Luiz into making a play for the ball before releasing to his Argentine colleague the key to City's opener. He put another chance on a plate for Aguero at the start of the second half only for the South American to squander. But it wasn't just those killer passes. It was more. So much more. For instance, there was a moment in the second half when goalkeeper Claudio Bravo pinged a pass out to Foden. Deep inside his own half, the manner in which Foden handled the situation was, arguably, far more impressive than his contribution to City's opener. An exemplary first touch, a quick look up before effortlessly side-stepping Ross Barkley to find a team-mate. Not a hint of panic. In a snapshot, Foden embodied exactly what Southgate - and Pep Guardiola - are looking for: the ability to retain possession under any circumstance. 'We cry out for this every year, young, English players to be given a chance at top teams. Phil Foden, there is a great season, hopefully, for him ahead,' former England captain Rio Ferdinand said on Sunday. 'England, what they lacked was that creativity, a bit of imagination, he has that in abundance, and we want to see him bring that to the Premier League.' There are, of course, bigger tests to follow for Foden. But as the curtain-raised on another season, it was one of English football's most promising talents that left us purring with excitement. Finally, England look to have a ball-playing central midfield capable of living up to the hype. We've been here before. Jack Wilshere, Josh McEachran and John Bostock would all testify to that. Indeed, their is a lingering fear for Foden - and Southgate - over the amount of football Guardiola is willing to afford his teenager over next nine months. Foden is far too good for academy and reserve level football. He may only be 18 - but he's outgrown junior football. He looks slight and scrawny but make no mistake - Foden is ready for the big time. It's a situation Guardiola must handle with care, but you'd back the Spaniard to call it correctly. 'He was ready last season, now he is one year more mature. He trained for all last year with us, and it is so good to have another player with his talents,' Guardiola said after Sunday's win. 'He is a Manchester City fan, a Mancunian, and that is why he is so good.' Foden left the field to a standing ovation. More performances like this and he'd better get used to it."
"Marcus Rashford has been handed the Manchester United No 10 shirt after unveiling his new squad number in their friendly with Bayern Munich on Sunday night. The young English striker was first seen in his new number after making a return to club action after the World Cup at the Allianz Arena. It was later confirmed by Manchester United's Twitter account following their 1-0 defeat. Rashford takes over the famed jersey from former incumbent Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was previously worn by the club's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney for 10 years. It remains to be seen whether the change from his former No 19 jersey means Rashford will given a more important role in Jose Mourinho's attack next season. Rashford revealed his delight at the decision on Instagram, posting a photo of him wearing the jersey with the caption: 'Wearing the shirt worn by United legends, honoured #MR10.' United's squad was boosted by the presence of Rashford and Phil Jones after Mourinho was able to include both England stars following their early return from summer breaks. Both players were due to be off until midweek, but agreed to come back prematurely to boost numbers. Rashford and Jones made their return to training on Saturday and took part at the Allianz Arena, their final tie before the start of the new season. Mourinho gave Rashford No 19 in 2016 after the 20-year-old broke through wearing No 39 under Louis Van Gaal.    'Yeah, he wanted it. He always wanted it,' Mourinho said of Rashford's switch from 19 to 10. 'Of course, he respected the big Rooney and then Zlatan wanted to have it. 'He was in the shadow, waiting for the opportunity and now the shirt is empty. It's something fantastic for the kid, let's give the shirt to him.' "
"The new Premier League season has finally arrived, and with it comes the hopes and expectations of many. Manchester City are hot favourites to continue their dominance under Pep Guardiola, while newcomers Wolves and Fulham have set down early markers with their aggressive approach to the transfer market. Sportsmail's resident expert PETER CROUCH gives his team-by-team guide for the campaign ahead.  How strange will it be in their first match against Manchester City when the camera switches to the dugout and Arsene Wenger is not there?  Wenger is all some people know of Arsenal and it is going to take everyone time to adjust. I do feel that change will be for the better, certainly in terms of the atmosphere at the Emirates. It had become toxic with so many wanting Wenger to go and it affected the players.  During Stoke’s game in April it felt like the home crowd were desperate to turn on him. It will be fascinating to see how Unai Emery gets on. He has been linked with jobs here before but with his pedigree he was always going to pick a top opportunity.  The squad he inherited is good and he’s made some interesting buys. I don’t expect to see them pushing for the title. They are still a good way short of the teams that set the standard. The realistic aim is trying to get back into the top four. HOW WILL THEY FARE? No title push but definite prospects of finishing in the top four. MAJOR INS Lucas Torreira (Sampdoria, £25m) Bernd Leno (B Leverkusen, £20m) Sokratis (Dortmund, £17m) Matteo Guendouzi (Lorient, £8m) Stephan Lichtsteiner (Juventus, free)  MAJOR OUTS Jack Wilshere (West Ham, free) Santi Cazorla (released) Per Mertesacker (retired)  The first thing you have to say when discussing Bournemouth is what a magnificent achievement it is for them to be looking at a fourth consecutive campaign in the top flight.  When you look at the size of the Vitality Stadium, it really isn’t geared up for the Premier League. Eddie Howe has done a tremendous job and has enhanced his reputation.  You have to admire the way they play football and, to give him full credit, he has remained loyal to his principles when the easiest thing would be to just try to get results. Each time they have looked in trouble, they have found a way to get out. But I have a feeling Bournemouth are going to find things difficult this season. There were a few bad teams in the Premier League last time and that helped them when they had a poor run.  Will they get away with it this time? I’m not sure. It’s not like they haven’t spent money, either, and you would be looking for some of those who have arrived for decent fees to produce. It is going be a long season for them. HOW WILL THEY FARE?  It will be touch and go whether they can stay up. MAJOR INS David Brooks (Sheffield Utd, £12m) Diego Rico (Leganes, £10.7m)  MAJOR OUTS Benik Afobe (Wolves, £10m) Lewis Grabban (Nottm Forest, £5m) Max Gradel (Toulouse, £1.8m) Adam Federici (Stoke, undisclosed) There were so many brilliant stories last season that Brighton’s achievement of staying up didn’t get the recognition it deserved. But here they are, looking forward to another crack at the Premier League.  My admiration for Chris Hughton, architect of their campaign, continues to grow. I go back a long way with Chris, who was my youth coach at Tottenham. He has gone on to prove himself a superb manager, first at Newcastle and then Norwich.  The players he has bought have fitted in well and I really like their centre backs, Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk. They don’t mess about, they get the job done and can play when it is required - just like the team as a whole.  It always gets said that the second season is the most difficult for teams who come out of the Championship but I’m pretty sure they will keep on surprising people. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Another season will see them get stronger. They won’t go down.

I wasn’t being disrespectful to Pep Guardiola or any of the other candidates but just an appreciation of the work Sean had done. Burnley being in Europe? Nobody would have predicted that. What a magnificent achievement. They remind me of how Stoke were at one point, with a team full of honest professionals all working for each other. They are going to find the demands put on them because of the Europa League taxing, when you have to go away to strange places on a Thursday and then play again on a Sunday. It was a problem for us in 2011-2012 and Tony Pulis took the decision to leave key players at home for league matches. But having worked so hard to get into Europe, Sean — who is clever and knows how to get results — will want them to do it properly. I don’t think they will match their seventh-placed finish but I’m confident they will be in the top 10 once again. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They are a good, solid side who will not be in the slightest trouble.  MAJOR INS None  MAJOR OUTS  Scott Arfield (Rangers, free) Chris Long (released) Dean Marney (released)  The one thing I will say with certainty where Cardiff are concerned is that every team who visits their stadium will be in for a horrible time. Neil Warnock isn’t going to try to win a prize for artistry. He is going to try to keep them in the division any way he can. It was a tactic that Stoke employed to great effect in the early years. We knew that certain teams hated coming to play us and were easily unsettled when the crowd got behind us and the game turned into a battle. It’s going to be interesting to see how the big teams cope in South Wales. If you had been given 10 goes to pick which team would come out of the Championship as runners-up, I don’t believe anyone would have picked Cardiff. They deserve huge credit for claiming back their place in the Premier League after a four-year break. Warnock’s teams are all about hard work, camaraderie and never giving up. They do have some quality in attack but let’s be realistic, if they finish one place above the relegation zone - whether it is by one point or one goal - they will have had an amazing season. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They are favourites to go down for a reason so 17th would be incredible.

Maurizio Sarri has replaced Antonio Conte and I enjoyed watching his Napoli teams. They were always on the front foot and aggressive. Sarri also pulled off some great business on his first day. Jorginho is a good signing and just what they need. They missed Nemanja Matic after his move to Manchester United and the midfielder will fill that hole. But while I respect Sarri’s credentials, he is totally unproven in England and you can’t escape the fact his relatively late arrival was far from ideal. There is also uncertainty surrounding the futures of Thibaut Courtois, Willian and Eden Hazard that won’t go until the European transfer window closes.  This is going to be a transitional season. Chelsea replace their managers all the time, so I wouldn’t say that will be a barrier to success. It just feels like they are in a similar situation to Arsenal. Pushing for the top four will be as good as it gets. HOW WILL THEY FARE? In the mix for the Champions League spots but no title challenge.  MAJOR INS Jorginho (Napoli, £57m) Rob Green (Huddersfield, free) MAJOR OUTS Jeremie Boga (Sassuolo, £3.6m) Eduardo (released) Kenedy (Newcastle, loan) Lewis Baker (Leeds, loan)  The way things started for Palace 12 months ago, I did not think for a moment they would be a Premier League team in August 2018. No goals and no points from seven matches should have finished them but fair play - they beat the drop comfortably in the end. Palace are established and have a manager in Roy Hodgson who has seen it all but there is no getting away from the fact they are unpredictable. Every year they lose games you think they will win then win games you don’t give them a chance in. A lot hinges on how Wilfried Zaha is going to perform. He is still relatively young and will make the odd mistake but he’s a special talent when everything clicks. It’s crucial they hang on to him — he gives Palace so much that it’s no surprise the big boys are watching. It would have been nice if they could have had another season of Ruben Loftus-Cheek - I thought he was special when he played against us at the Bet365 Stadium in May - but they will pick up the points they need. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They’ll get plenty of points at Selhurst Park — it’s always a difficult place to play!  MAJOR INS Cheikhou Kouyate (West Ham, £9.5m) Max Meyer (Schalke, free) Vicente Guaita (Getafe, free) MAJOR OUTS  Damien Delaney (Cork City, free) Yohan Cabaye (Al-Nasr, free) Lee Chung-yong (released) Bakary Sako (released)  When I joined Sportsmail, Marco Silva was my first pick for the ‘who’s caught my eye’ section. He is a very impressive manager and I thought he did very well with Hull and Watford. He wants his teams to play with style and aggression. I rate him highly. Everton were in a similar situation to Arsenal in that they had to change the man in charge. I don’t think Sam Allardyce was popular and they couldn’t let that situation carry on. They just did not play well at any point last season. It may take time for Silva’s methods to work, though. I know Everton have spent fortunes in the last 18 months — close to £300million — but there is a rebuilding job to do and I don’t think it will be completed quickly. There is no point at this stage making big predictions for them. Silva needs time to put his stamp on the side and the basic target has to be a season of improvement and enjoyment for the supporters. When it all clicks, you can see them getting some big wins at Goodison Park. HOW WILL THEY FARE?  I don't think they can challenge the top six but should be comfortably in the top 10.  MAJOR INS  Richarlison (Watford, £44.5m) Lucas Digne (Barcelona, £18m)  MAJOR OUTS Wayne Rooney (DC United, free) Ramiro Funes Mori (Villarreal, £8m) Joel Robles (Real Betis, free)  Every summer there is a signing that makes you look and think, ‘How did that happen?’ I would say this year’s contender is Fulham’s capture of midfielder Jean Michael Seri from Nice. He’s been linked to lots of top clubs and I just didn’t think he would end up at Craven Cottage. It’s going to be interesting to see how they get on back in the Premier League. They are a good club and have one of the most exciting young English players in Ryan Sessegnon. He tore up the Championship last year and I don’t think he will be fazed about going up a level. Clearly, it’s gutting from a personal point of view that Fulham have taken our place in the Premier League. I always enjoyed my trips to Craven Cottage and it’s a stadium I have always enjoyed visiting. But so have plenty of others and that was a problem for them. If teams look forward to playing at your ground, it is usually a sign you are giving too many points away. This current team and their manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, strike me as having an edge to them. They have bought well and have got a good squad. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They will win more than they lose. I do not see them being relegated.  MAJOR INS Aleksandar Mitrovic (Newcastle, £20m) Alfie Mawson (Swansea, £20m) Jean Michael Seri (Nice, £18m) Fabri (Besiktas, £5.4m) Maxime Le Marchand (Nice, £3.6m) Andre Schurrle (Dortmund, loan) MAJOR OUTS David Button (Brighton, £4m) Ryan Fredericks (West Ham, free) When I was picking my manager of the year, I could have easily chosen David Wagner. Everybody at their club admitted it was going to take a miracle to stay up but Wagner was able to deliver the miracle. Obviously I can’t be too happy for them as they are where we want to be but as a footballer, I have total respect for the way those players got behind Wagner’s approach and squeezed the points from the games they needed. But can they do it again? I’m not sure. There will be a recognition within the squad that they are going to be near the bottom again and it’s going to be a big test of their new signings, all of whom seem to have arrived from Europe.  It could be a culture shock. To stand any chance of beating relegation for a second time, they have to hit the ground running but with Chelsea and Manchester City in their first two games, the tone could be set early. Another huge effort is required for another miracle. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Similar to Cardiff, finish 17th and that will be a huge success.  MAJOR INS Terence Kongolo (Monaco, £18m) Adama Diakhaby (Monaco, £8m) Ramadan Sobhi (Stoke, £5.9m) Florent Hadergjonaj (Ingolstadt, £5m) Juninho Bacuna (Groningen, £2.3m) Jonas Lossl (Mainz, £2.3m) Erik Durm (Dortmund, free) Ben Hamer (Leicester, free)  MAJOR OUTS Tom Ince (Stoke, £12m) Rob Green (Chelsea, free) There is no doubt that losing a player of Riyad Mahrez’s quality is a big blow but I like Leicester and think they will have a good season. This could be the year Demarai Gray steps forward and shows the potential that has been there for some time. What impresses me about Leicester is how solid they look. Kasper Schmeichel had a fantastic World Cup with Denmark and has seen it all, while the signing of Jonny Evans, to go alongside Harry Maguire in defence, was so sensible. When you add Jamie Vardy - who, fitness permitting, will score 20 goals - into the mix, you can see why I believe they will be in the top 10 and pushing for a place in Europe.  Everyone has watched Leicester with interest since they won the title in 2016. Things never went according to plan for the 12 months that followed but they look to be on a stable footing. Why can’t they win one of the cups? HOW WILL THEY FARE? They can get involved with the race for Europe  MAJOR INS James Maddison (Norwich, £24m) Ricardo Pereira (Porto, £22m) Danny Ward (Liverpool, £12.5m) Jonny Evans (West Brom, £3.6m) MAJOR OUTS Riyad Mahrez (Man City, £60m) Connor Wood (Bradford, undisc) Ben Hamer (Huddersfield, free) Robert Huth (released) My old club have had the most impressive summer in terms of transfer business and friendly results have been encouraging. The build-up to the season has been smooth. It’s going to be interesting watching Naby Keita in midfield. Stoke played RB Leipzig in a friendly this time last year. We won 2-1 but I came away thinking what a good player he was, so fast and dynamic. Liverpool needed something extra in midfield and he will give it to them. Keeping Mohamed Salah was critical and if he scores even half of the goals he managed last season, they are going to win lots of games. The addition of Alisson was expensive but they needed to address the goalkeeping position. If it clicks for Liverpool, they will be the team that comes closest to stopping Manchester City. They have been so exciting to watch and I can see it continuing. I know what it would mean to their fans if they went all the way. HOW WILL THEY FARE? All systems go for a title challenge. They are City's biggest threat.  MAJOR INS Alisson (Roma, £65m) Naby Keita (RB Leipzig, £55m) Fabinho (Monaco, £44m) Xherdan Shaqiri (Stoke, £13m) MAJOR OUTS Danny Ward (Leicester, £12.5m) Emre Can (Juventus, free) Ovie Ejaria (Rangers, loan) Jon Flanagan (Rangers, free) One of the easiest subjects I had to write on during my first year with Sportsmail was Pep Guardiola’s team. I kept saying they were on a par with Manchester United’s Treble winners and Arsenal’s Invincibles. We will always remember City as The Centurions. To score more than 100 goals and finish with 100 points showed how much of a class above they were. When we faced them at Stoke in March, it felt at times as if they were playing a game that was two levels above anything we could match. It was frightening. They may have ‘only’ added Riyad Mahrez during the window but the squad is so deep and has such quality that Guardiola wasn’t facing an emergency in terms of strengthening. Basically, I can’t see anything changing their dominance. The big thing for them this season will be the Champions League. They have the numbers to make changes but not dilute their quality. Granted some luck, I can see them going very close in Europe, too. HOW WILL THEY FARE? A class above the rest. I expect them to be champions again.  MAJOR INS Riyad Mahrez (Leicester, £60m)  MAJOR OUTS  Angus Gunn (Southampton, £13.5m) Pablo Maffeo (Stuttgart, £8.8m) Angelino (PSV, £5m) Yaya Toure (released) Looking in from the outside, you don’t need to be a genius to realise this summer has not gone as they would have wanted. A word of warning, though, to anyone who feels they are in trouble: never write off a Jose Mourinho team. When all the players are back, look at the depth of their squad. Tell me how a team with Paul Pogba in midfield and Romelu Lukaku up front won’t win loads of matches? Pogba is someone I’m very keen on watching over the next 12 months.  He should come back from the World Cup full of confidence and I want to see him stamp his authority on the biggest games, like he did in April’s Manchester derby. If United add a central defender, they have the quality to push City all the way. I can’t talk about United, though, without mentioning their signing of goalkeeper Lee Grant. It has gone under the radar but it makes so much sense and I’d expect before long that he will be David de Gea’s No 2. He is different class and he deserves to be at a club that will be expecting to challenge for honours. HOW WILL THEY FARE? No chance of losing their top four place and don't rule out a title push.  MAJOR INS  Fred (Shakhtar Donetsk, £52m) Diogo Dalot (Porto, £17.4m) Lee Grant (Stoke, £1.5m)  MAJOR OUTS Daley Blind (Ajax, £18m) Sam Johnstone (West Brom, £5m) Michael Carrick (retired)  You look from afar and see a club that has everything to take off. In Rafa Benitez they have a fantastic manager whose success at the top speaks for itself. Every time you go to St James’ Park, you feel how desperate the fans are for success but you also know they have been unhappy for some time with the ownership. Clearly the owners are operating to a different agenda to Rafa’s. If they were all pulling in the same direction what could they achieve? Until that day arrives they will continue to be in mid-table, heading towards the top 10. They look short of goals but I like the signing of Ki Sung-yueng, who’s always impressed me. He is a good midfielder with plenty of ability - and those sentiments can also be applied to Jonjo Shelvey. If he kicks on again, I don’t see why he won’t be considered for England. They have more than enough to get the results Newcastle need. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They won’t be anywhere near trouble at the bottom but they will be short of the European places.

They have spent a lot of money and Mark Hughes, a manager I know well, has assembled a good squad. Stuart Armstrong from Celtic looks a smart acquisition. I watched a few Celtic games last season and he always caught the eye. Brendan Rodgers spoke positively about him and I’ll be interested to see how he handles the switch from Scotland. I expect them to be comfortably safe but you can imagine the fans will want a little bit more than just safety, pushing for the top 10. They are an established Premier League club and spent back-to-back seasons in Europe. Saying that, Dusan Tadic, who has been sold to Ajax, is a big loss. He was always capable of doing something unexpected and making a difference. The one thing they need is a match winner. HOW WILL THEY FARE? The worries of relegation won’t arise this time and the minimum target should be top 10.

It has led some people to suggest their run of three consecutive years inside the Premier League’s top three will end. Unless I’m missing something, don’t Tottenham still have the players who were responsible for getting those results? The best business they could have made this summer was securing Harry Kane  to a new long-term deal and that was mission accomplished. Initially my concern for them would be the fact they had nine players involved in the World Cup semi-finals and there could be a slight hangover. If you don’t have a proper pre-season, you have to play catch up and it leads to early sluggishness. But I don’t have any worries about how they will perform over the campaign as a whole. Mauricio Pochettino is a fantastic manager and the squad continues to improve. If they can add Jack Grealish before the deadline, he has the potential to get into the England squad. HOW WILL THEY FARE? One of the best teams in Europe, never mind one of the best teams in England. Certainties for the top four.  MAJOR INS None  MAJOR OUTS  Keanan Bennetts (Gladbach, £2m) Anton Walkes (Portsmouth, £200k)  It’s hard to know what to make of them. Vicarage Road is a traditional ground and the fans get right behind them but the actual set-up is odd.  They have gone through so many managers but it seems to work. The fact they are continually changing, though, means they lack identity. They have a few players most football fans around the country would struggle to name and most of their signings leave you asking, ‘Who’s he?’.  This approach wouldn’t suit every club but they’ve established themselves in the Premier League. Being established, however, doesn’t mean anything. Stoke were in the top flight for 10 years and look where we are now.  Saying that, I can see them getting big results along the way, as they always do. In recent years they have beaten Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Chelsea at home and I would imagine they will get another success like that this season. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Should stay up but are going to lose more than they win. One day it’ll catch up with them.  MAJOR INS Gerard Deulofeu (Barcelona, £15m) Adam Masina (Bologna, £4.5m) Ben Foster (West Brom, £4m) Ken Sema (Ostersunds, £2m) Marc Navarro (Espanyol, £1.8m) Ben Wilmot (Stevenage, £1.5m) MAJOR OUTS Richarlison (Everton, £44.5m) Nordin Amrabat (Al Nassr, £4m) Costel Pantilimon (N Forest, undisc) If it had not been for Liverpool’s spectacular dealings, all eyes would have been on West Ham. After the disappointment and unhappiness of last year, the owners have gone for it in a big way.  Give them credit, they have not messed around. Midfielder Felipe Anderson, for a club record, and Jack Wilshere have been the headline-grabbing arrivals but I like the signing of Andriy Yarmolenko, too. I know Stoke tried to sign him once. He is an exciting player who will score and create goals, which should help relieve the pressure on Marko Arnautovic, who had too much responsibility on his shoulders last season.  Marko is someone I know well and I rate him highly. He is going to be the key man again and I can see people raving about him. Manuel Pellegrini sets his teams up to attack and it will be entertaining at the London Stadium - which is what the fans want. HOW WILL THEY FARE?

With Wolves, though, I think we change that statement. We played them a few weeks ago in a friendly.  I was up front and wanted to test their three central defenders to see what they were like, pulling on them to see if I could expose them. They all stood up to it. Given they won the Championship with such exciting football, I thought they would be vulnerable defensively but they are solid and have got quality in all areas.  Ruben Neves is a class act in midfield while Morgan Gibbs-White, who won the Under-17 World Cup with England, has a bright future. Be under no illusion, this is a good side. I was very impressed with them and they look well equipped for the battle ahead. They won’t be anywhere near trouble. HOW WILL THEY FARE?

"There will be a time, probably in the first game of the Premier League season, when fans will be waiting for VAR to correct a perceived injustice. They'll be making the TV signal in the stands and on the sofa at home! Except, VAR isn't there. I've been asked if the Premier League have missed a trick by not implementing video technology, especially as it was so well received at the World Cup. But they are right to wait another 12 months. A good referee does not make a good VAR referee, and the Premier League need to find both and give them more experience. One of the big concerns from last season was the time it took to review decisions. The Premier League did not want to spoil the flow of the game, because this league is the fastest in the world.  I get that, but if you look at the World Cup, it did not feel as if the reviews impacted on the game. There was a time towards the end of the group stage when VAR was coming in for a bit of criticism. But after the reversal of an offside decision to award South Korea a goal in their 2-0 win over Germany, attitudes changed, with the pundits in the TV studios and at home. It added to the drama of that game, and it was the correct call. I want to see the system become more transparent though. The decision should be shown on a big screen in the stadium and I want to hear what the referees are saying to each other. By the time VAR comes into use in the Premier League, I hope the transparency is there. For now, we have to wait — it will definitely be worth it. STOP SHIRT-PULLING  Where do you start with shirt-pulling in the penalty area? Well, you start by referees stamping it out without the need for VAR. The best referees will have studied the players they are refereeing and should be aware of tactics such as shirt-pulling and blocking from set-pieces. Give a warning before the corner or free-kick has been taken and then no player can complain if you award a foul. VAR was a deterrent at the World Cup, leading to more space and more goals from set-pieces. Good referees should do the same by making players aware they are on to them. In the early weeks we will see referees being extra vigilant. But let's not go from one extreme to the other. Remember, a lot of the time the attacker is holding the defender just as much as the reverse. I want to see referees being brave enough and clever enough to make the obvious calls, because that will lead to more goals and more entertainment - and that's what we all want to see. "
"His first FA Community Shield will not figure in the upper echelons when Pep Guardiola settles into his rocking chair with a pencil and paper for the final reckoning. The prize will probably not make his Top 20 by the time to chart his mammoth haul of prizes but he will have taken great satisfaction from 90 minutes spent basking in the London sun in his baggy cream tee-shirt. Guardiola would have turned up at Wembley searching for signs from his Manchester City team. Chelsea (4-3-3): Caballero 6; Azpilicueta (c) 5, Rudiger 5, Luiz 4.5, Alonso 5; Fabregas 4.5 (Drinkwater 60, 6), Jorginho 5, Barkley 5; Pedro 5 (Moses 79), Morata 4.5 (Abraham 69, 6), Hudson-Odoi 6 (Willian 59, 6) Substitutes not used: Bulka (GK);  Zappacosta, Christensen Manager: Maurizio Sarri 5  Manchester City (4-3-3): Bravo 6.5; Walker 7, Stones 7.5 (Gomes 90+4), Laporte 7.5 (Otamendi 87), Mendy 7; Foden 7.5 (Diaz 76), Fernandinho (c) 7, B. Silva 8; Mahrez 7 (Gabriel Jesus 68, 6.5), Aguero 8.5 (Kompany 80), Sane 6 (Gundogan 46, 6.5) Substitutes not used: Ederson (GK) Manager: Pep Guardiola 8  Scorer: Aguero 13, 58 Referee: Jonathan Moss 6 He will have hoped to find desire in the eyes of those players who amassed 100 points and 106 goals in the Premier League last season. It is a decade since any team successfully defended the title. In fact, Chelsea, hapless Wembley victims on this occasion, have become experts in turning the task into a complete shambles. He will have sought proof that no-one had lost their appetite after a summer at the World Cup - and evidence that others were emerging to push them and keep momentum rolling by injecting freshness. Here it was, pretty much all of the above. Albeit against a team with their best players missing and clearly lots of groundwork still to be done by Maurizio Sarri. The new Chelsea manager, just over three weeks into the job, wants to see his team play with speed and adventure akin to Manchester City but they are far from the same levels of fluency and understanding. Sergio Aguero looked sleek and keen as he erased the memories of what was a most miserable World Cup. Aguero helped himself to a goal in each half. The first took his City tally to 200 and there might have been a hat-trick without a strong performance from his Argentina teammate Willy Caballero in goal for Chelsea.  He took the Man of the Match award from the sponsors and yet those who were at Wembley will recall this as they day they saw Phil Foden begin to transform his huge potential into something more tangible.  At 18, Foden dazzled and received a standing ovation when he was replaced, having succumbed to cramp, 15 minutes from time. His jinking runs punctured holes in Chelsea’s defence, his touch was sure and his passes were crisp and accurate, like the one which found Aguero on the edge of the penalty area for the opening goal. Aguero feinted to go one way, twisted the other and was afforded the time to slam the ball low past Antonio Rudiger’s attempted block and the dive of Caballero.  Another explosive change of pace from Foden in the first half left Jorginho trailing as he cut through the centre and found Riyad Mahrez in space. Mahrez was betrayed by his touch, which offered a reminder of the technical polish which is now the norm at City. When a player fails to stop the ball with precision and poise, it simply jars with the rhythm.  Foden and Bernardo Silva, who started out in the roles normally occupied by David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne, were sublime, with such vision and awareness of others around them and maturity and confidence in their decisions. Bernardo was shifted out wide after the interval to equal effect and received special praise from Guardiola for his display, which the manager thought proved him to be ahead of the other creative players in his squad. Foden picked out another Aguero run, early in the second half and the striker skipped around the goalkeeper only to slice a shot into the side-netting. It was Bernardo who created his second. The striker dashed away from Rudiger and behind David Luiz to apply a low finish to a perfectly weighed pass. Chelsea wilted in the heat where City did not. They have players still to return, including N’Golo Kante and Eden Hazard, their two most important under Antonio Conte. Even so, Sarri had plenty of occupy his thoughts as he paced the touchline chewing furiously on the gum he has chosen to replace the cigarettes. Jorginho was the signing he wanted above all others, the key to setting the tempo and dictating the style he craves. He was stolen from under City’s noses but Brazil-born Italian international was hustled out of his stride as he took risks on the ball, sitting deep in midfield, on the toes of his central defenders.    Aguero has now scored 10 goals against Chelsea for City. This is only bettered by the 14 he's netted against Newcastle.  One misplaced pass allowed Leroy Sane to burst clear midway through the first half and Caballero dashed from his line to smother the chance. Up front, 17-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi flickered and threatened from the left and forced an error from Claudio Bravo with a shot which skidded off the turf and surprised the ‘keeper. Bravo escaped another misjudgement, this time beaten by the bounce of a long punt forward from Marcos Alonso, and Chelsea rarely looked capable of testing him with anything more deliberate. Alvaro Morata offered nothing to suggest a change of manager and a change of shirt number was about to bring him a change of fortune in blue.  Morata started his Chelsea career by missing a penalty in a shoot-out in last year’s Community Shield before his first season drifted away into disappointment. Here, he went off in a blur of substitutions as the FA Cup winners were saved from the realms of humiliation by Caballero’s defiance. There would be no hat-trick for Aguero but there was an ominous purr to the champions.  "
"Manchester City claimed the first silverware of the new campaign as they beat Chelsea 2-0 in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday. Sergio Aguero hit a brace for Pep Guardiola's side but there was plenty going on aside from the main action. Here Sportsmail looks at seven things you may have missed from the Community Shield. Aguero is known for his clinical nature in front of goal, but the City striker had a moment to forget in the first half when his wayward effort hit the corner flag. The Argentina international soon atoned for his error, though, as he opened the scoring shortly afterwards and he then scored again in the second half. Aguero is also now City's outright leading scorer at Wembley as he has found the net at the national stadium five times, with Yaya Toure in second place with three goals. Under Antonio Conte, David Luiz had fallen down the pecking order to such an extent that it seemed highly likely that he would leave Chelsea. However, with Conte now out of the picture, Luiz is back in the frame, and new boss Maurizio Sarri handed the centre-back his first competitive appearance since the 4-1 defeat by Watford on February 5, 181 days ago. Kevin De Bruyne may not yet be considered fit enough to play after featuring for Belgium at the World Cup, but the midfielder was still an interested spectator at Wembley.  De Bruyne watched on as City prevailed past his former side and will hope that he will soon be back on the field himself.  Another notable observer was Arsenal head coach Unai Emery, whose side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on August 18. It has become a common theme in recent years for the previous season's FA Cup winners to prevail in this fixture, but City managed to buck that trend.  Prior to today, the last four editions of the Community Shield had been won by the reigning FA Cup champions, with Manchester United (in 2013) previously the most recent league-winning side to win the traditional curtain-raiser. Claudio Bravo may have kept a clean sheet but the City goalkeeper's well-documented habit of making costly errors very nearly resurfaced. Just prior to half-time, Bravo needlessly came off his line and almost got caught out by Marcos Alonso's lofted through ball. The Chilean misjudged the ball's bounce and could only watch as it flew over him towards his goal. He just about managed to scramble back towards his line to grab the ball and avoid humiliation. Ilkay Gundogan featured as a second-half substitute for City as he made his return to action and the midfielder did so while wearing a face mask. Gundogan underwent an operation to fix a deviated septum following Germany's exit from the World Cup and on Sunday he became the latest player to sport the eye-catching headwear to protect his nose. Talented youngster Claudio Gomes officially completed his move to City from Paris Saint-Germain recently and was named among the substitutes at Wembley. Gomes was brought on for the last few seconds as he made his first competitive appearance in senior football.  One appearance, one trophy. That's not a bad hit ratio! "
"Manchester City claimed the first silverware of the domestic campaign on Sunday as they convincingly beat Chelsea 2-0 in the Community Shield at Wembley. Sergio Aguero scored in each half as the Argentine striker passed 200 goals for the reigning Premier League champions. It was a tough start to English football for new Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri and poses more questions for the Italian ahead of the Premier League launch next weekend.  Here, Sportsmail's KIERAN GILL runs the rule over both sets of players from Wembley. CHELSEA (4-3-3) Willy Caballero – 6 Defence often left Caballero venerable. No chance of stopping Aguero’s first strike and produced several saves to keep the scoreline respectable. Cesar Azpilicueta – 5 Captained the side. Frustrated by a lack of options ahead of him on the rare occasion he burst down the right wing. Antonio Rudiger – 5 Poor defending for City’s opening goal – practically stepped to the side so Aguero could aim for the bottom corner. David Luiz – 4.5 One of the culprits who backed off as City charged forward to score their opener. Caught out too many times. Marcos Alonso – 5 Mahrez was often too hot to handle on the right wing for Alonso. Tried to support Hudson-Odoi on the wing. Cesc Fabregas – 4.5 Not his day. No protection for the back four with a gaping gap between defence and midfield. Chelsea missed N’Golo Kante. Jorginho – 5 Unusually sloppy at times. City tried to let Chelsea’s £57m signing have as little time on the ball as possible. Ross Barkley – 5 Looking fit and strong but suffered an anonymous first half. He and Fabregas struggled to have an impact.  Pedro – 5 Not very influential in Chelsea’s front three. Quiet. Surprised Sarri did not substitute the Spaniard sooner. Alvaro Morata – 4.5 New number on his back, but same old Morata. His one chance to score went into the stands. Callum Hudson-Odoi – 6 Tremendous confidence for a teenager. Often Chelsea’s main threat in attack, particularly in the first half at Wembley. MANAGER Maurizio Sarri – 5 Defence needs work. Difficult to judge Chelsea under Sarri until Eden Hazard and N’Golo Kante are back. SUBS Willian (for Hudson-Odoi, 60) – 6 Danny Drinkwater (for Fabregas, 60) – 6 Tammy Abraham (for Morata, 69) – 6 Victor Moses (for Pedro, 79) MANCHESTER CITY (4-3-3) Claudio Bravo – 6.5 The odd frightening moment, such as when he misjudged a bounce and the ball went over his head. Got away with it.  Kyle Walker – 7 England full-back showed his experience when marking Hudson-Odoi. Barely put a foot wrong, like a lot of his team-mates. John Stones – 7.5 A straightforward day at the office for the central defender. No drama. Interestingly moved into midfield by Guardiola. America Laporte – 7.5 Laporte’s brilliant ball into the centre of midfield cut Chelsea open and started the move that led to Aguero’s opener. Benjamin Mendy – 7 Good to see Mendy looking so fit following last season’s horror injury. Lots of overlapping runs on the left wing.  Bernardo Silva – 8 Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva were absent but Silva did a superb job in midfield. Did everything asked of him and more. Fernandinho – 7 Tidy job in midfield and a key part of the City press that left Chelsea struggling. Commanding in front of the defence. Phil Foden – 7.5 Helped drive City forward and set Aguero up for his opener. Such a talent for an 18-year-old.  Riyad Mahrez – 7 Had Alonso on toast at times. Came close to grabbing a goal in the second half. Not a bad start to his City career. Sergio Aguero – 8.5 Fine finish for his first goal and nicely tucked the ball under Caballero for his second. Could have had a hat-trick. Leroy Sane – 6 Quiet by his standards. Hugged the touchline but ball barely came his way. Substituted at half time because of a knock. MANAGER Pep Guardiola – 8 Frantic on the touchline as per. His team will take some beating for the Premier League title this season. SUBS Ilkay Gundogan (for Sane, 45) – 6.5 Gabriel Jesus (for Mahrez, 68) – 6.5 Brahim Diaz (for Foden, 76) Vincent Kompany (for Aguero, 80) Nicolas Otamendi (for Laporte, 87) Claudio Gomes (for Stones, 90)  REFEREE Jon Moss – 6 No drama for the officials here. Video assistant referee did not need to be called upon. "
"Pep Guardiola fired a chilling warning to Manchester City's rivals, insisting Sergio Aguero is ready to have his most prolific season yet. The Argentina striker bolstered his position as a City legend on Sunday by surpassing the 200 goal mark for the club, scoring both goals in the Community Shield win over Chelsea. And Guardiola believes Aguero, who scored 30 goals last season, could be on course for his best season yet, insisting the decision for the striker to undergo knee surgery last April will see the South American go from strength to strength. 'We were really impressed when he arrived (back for pre-season),' said Guardiola. 'Sergio always has a little bit (of a problem) with his physicality. Maybe he needs a little bit more time to take his physical condition. 'But he arrived so sharp, so good. I think at the end of last season, the knee operation; he suffered the previous years with a little bit of a problem and Ramon Cugat the best doctor in the world made the perfect surgery and now he feels free. 'I think it's good news for us for the season. He scored two goals, produced chances, he could have scored three or four or five.'  Guardiola was just as high in his praise of Bernardo Silva, who produced an excellent display in City's midfield. And the City manager has hinted the Portugal star can break up the Kevin De Bruyne/David Silva central midfield partnership that served his team so well last year. 'Today the performance of Bernardo Silva was a masterpiece,' said Guardiola. 'Everybody knows the wingers want to compete. Right now, it is Bernardo and 10 players more. Right now. 'But in 11 months it depends on what they show me on the pitch. Always I say the same to the players. ""You want to talk to me? Talk to me on the green (grass)"". 'And that moment Bernardo is far away from other guys so that's why at the moment he plays. 'Definitely he can challenge De Bruyne and Silva in that position. He can also play right-back and sometimes the false nine. 'He is so intelligent, he is clever. He is a fighter, a competitor. I think he is the guy most beloved in our team and today he showed me a lot of things. 'He came back earlier and that showed me again a lot of things and that's one of the reasons we won today. It was for many reasons. One of the reasons was Bernardo.'  On winning City's first piece of silverware of the season, Guardiola added: 'I am so satisfied. It's a minor title, everybody is going for the Premier League, the FA Cup or the Champions League.  'But to play for this title you have to win the Premier League or the FA Cup so to play this competition is not easy. 'We are still far away from the physical condition we want to be in; we are far, far away.  'The players are in a bad, bad condition and hopefully this week we have seven days and the next week seven days more where we can increase our level.'"
"Sergio Aguero was the star of the show as Manchester City downed Chelsea to win the Community Shield, and Rio Ferdinand has singled him out as the league's finest. Aguero's brace was enough to see City take a comfortable 2-0 victory and pick up the first piece of silverware of the season. The Argentinian hit struck two clinical efforts, leaving pundit Ferdinand waxing lyrical about his abilities. It took Aguero's all-time goalscoring tally to 200 for City, making him one of the most prolific of all time.  'Getting 200 league goals for Manchester City is a phenomenal amount, and I think he is the best striker in the Premier League, he was the hardest I played against, fantastic movement, pace and awareness,' said Ferdinand on BT Sport. 'I would take him over Harry Kane. In terms of someone who is hard to play against, he brings so much off both feet, and with his movement and pace he offers all sorts of problems.   'Kane is a great player, but Aguero just takes it.' Aguero is set to spend the season contending with Gabriel Jesus as the focal point of Pep Guardiola's attack. The Argentinian at times found his chances limited last year, before Jesus was struck by injury. City will open their Premier League campaign away to Arsenal on Sunday, August 12. "
"Sergio Aguero reached the 200-goal milestone for Manchester City with his strike against Chelsea in Sunday's Community shield. The Argentina striker wrote himself into City's history books by becoming their record goalscorer with his strike against Napoli in the Champions League back in November, which broke Eric Brook's 77-year record.  And now he's joined the elite 200-club, Sportsmail counts down the 10 very best goals Aguero has scored in a City shirt since his arrival in July 2011. A trait that marks Aguero out as one of the Premier League's most deadly strikers is his willingness to pull the trigger early to take goalkeepers by surprise. Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, with City 1-0 down, Aguero demonstrated brilliant awareness by timing his run perfectly in behind Gary Cahill and John Terry to latch onto Javi Garcia's through-ball.  Without taking a touch and without even looking up, Aguero fired a rasping effort into the top corner with his weaker left foot, catching Petr Cech unprepared and equalising for the away side. Though City would go on to lose the match 2-1 with a rare Fernando Torres Chelsea goal settling the contest, Aguero's strike left the away supporters with a memorable moment to take with them back to Manchester.   City's Argentine strike partnership of Aguero and Carlos Tevez combined to devastating effect at Carrow Road as they bagged five between them putting feeble Norwich to the sword. Aguero's first and City's second saw him strolling into Norwich territory before touching on to his compatriot with a flick of his right boot. Tevez returned the favour with a clever back-heel and Aguero finished with aplomb by walloping home a bouncing ball into the top corner from the edge of the area. An outstanding finish from an incredibly tight angle that demonstrated the Argentine's unerring accuracy in front of goal. Kevin De Bruyne's through-ball made its way to Raheem Sterling but Tom Heaton made a brave, lunging save to dispossess the England winger.  Heaton picked himself up and dived at Aguero's feet but the striker still managed to rifle home with his right foot from an improbable angle despite two Burnley defenders positioning themselves on the goal-line. His shot flew past Michael Keane, ricocheted off the post and struck a dumb-founded Matt Lowton on its way in as 10-man City went 2-0 up.  Another goal scored from a tough angle, Aguero bagged his hat-trick against Watford at Vicarage Road in some style. Having netted twice in the first half, Aguero collected the ball around 30 yards out from goal with nine minutes remaining and City already four goals up. He surged past two defenders and bamboozled another two using a clever in-out skill with his right foot, waiting for Heurelho Gomes to go to ground before tucking home past the helpless Watford stopper. Aguero had already bagged two hat-tricks during the 2017-18 season before this four-goal haul against Leicester. The Argentine had helped himself to a second-half treble via a simple tap-in, a powerful effort which was too hot for Kasper Schmeichel to handle and a neat chip after a mistake from the goalkeeper.  But Aguero saved his best for last. And in the final minute he was given too much space on the edge of the area and punished Leicester by smashing an unstoppable effort past Schmeichel that clipped the underside of the crossbar on it's way in. Aguero arrived at City from Atletico Madrid for £32million in the summer of 2011 and quickly set about repaying that then-club-record fee. Having been introduced as a second-half substitute, Aguero opened his account for the club just nine minutes into his debut by tapping home at the far post.  But it was in the 85th minute that Aguero truly announced himself on the Premeir League stage with a stunning second to put City four goals up. Aguero collected possession 30 yards out from goal and unleashed a dipping, swerving effort which flew into the side-netting past a helpless Michel Vorm to cap off a dream debut and down newly-promoted Swansea. Yet another Aguero goal scored from an incredibly tight angle salvaged a point for City in this home Premier League clash in February 2013. City were trailing 2-1 to Steven Gerrard's thumping effort when an aimless ball forward was hunted down by the tireless Aguero.  Martin Skrtel looked to have shepherded Aguero to the edge of the box but Pepe Reina then needlessly charged off his line to meet the striker. Aguero took a touch with his thigh, taking the ball even further away from goal before squeezing home a right-footed effort just inside the far post to leave Liverpool's defence stunned and Reina with egg on his face. Overshadowed slightly by Robert Lewandowski's five goals in nine minutes just days earlier, Aguero's five in 20 minutes against Newcastle was a remarkable feat.   Incredibly Aguero's first of the afternoon, scored just before the interval to bring City level, had ended the striker's run of 595 minutes without a goal in open play. But after the interval the floodgates well and truly opened as Aguero rediscovered his form in spectacular fashion with four further goals scored in quick succession. The best of the five-star display was his fourth. Aguero clipped the ball over Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul with a stylish dink from the edge of the area after a slick passing move involving De Bruyne, Fernandinho and David Silva. Aguero would have fancied his chances of becoming the first player to score six goals in a Premier League game but his manager Manuel Pellegrino ruthlessly hauled him off in just the 66th minute. A brilliant strike which left Manchester United's defenders looking completely dumbfounded and produced a signature Phil Jones expression.  After collecting Yaya Toure's pass, Aguero led United's backline on a merry dance with a mazy run which took him from outside the area to the six-yard box with four touches of his right foot. And with his fifth touch, substitute Aguero demonstrated remarkable balance to get his shot off and rifle home into the roof of the net past David De Gea.  The 78th-minute winner at Old Trafford wasn't enough to haul City back into the 2012/13 Premier League title race but it earned Roberto Mancini's team a satisfying victory in the Manchester derby.   The most iconic and most important goal in Premier League history, No 1 on the list could only be Aguero's title-winning strike in May 2012.  Relegation-threatened QPR were 2-1 up heading into stoppage time and the title was slipping painfully from City's grasp and into the hands of United.   City hauled themselves level with a header from Edin Dzeko but still needed another to secure the club's first title since 1968. Cue Aguero bailing his side out and clinching the Premier League title in the most climactic end to a top-flight season in the modern era. In the dying seconds of added time, amid a feverish atmosphere at the Etihad, Aguero proved the calmest man in the stadium when his team needed him most. The striker picked up the ball 30 yards out and flicked a pass inside to Mario Balotelli before running on to the return, knocking it past a defender and firing home. 'Agueroooooooooo,' screamed Martin Tyler on the Sky Sports commentary. 'I swear you'll never see anything like this ever again. So watch it, drink it in.' "
"Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri has opened the door to Thibaut Courtois securing his dream move to Real Madrid this week. Belgium international Courtois is due to report for pre-season on Monday morning but is pining for a move to Spain. Courtois has a season left on his current deal which exposes Chelsea to the possibility of losing him for nothing next year. The goalkeeper's agent Christophe Henrotay has called on the club to grant his client a move to the Spanish capital, where his children live with his ex-partner. Sarri appears to be ready to let Courtois leave before Thursday's transfer deadline, provided the keeper tells him he wants to leave when they meet face-to-face on Monday. 'I have no reaction on the agent. I'm not interested in the agent,' said Sarri.  'I want to hear Courtois. If Courtois says the same, I have to speak with my club of course because I only want players with a very high level of motivation.' Courtois himself refused to comment further on the speculation on Sunday. The goalkeeper was a special guest at a friendly match involving former club Genk. Asked about the transfer saga, he said:  I'm not going to comment. It's all delicate. I'm relaxed at the moment.'"
"Manchester City absolutely laid down a marker against Chelsea. With this performance, Pep Guardiola’s side basically told their Premier League rivals: ‘You’re going to have to do a lot to beat us this season.’ They were on a different level from Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea at Wembley.  City have so much strength in depth in their squad and they still have players to come back, such as the wonderful Kevin De Bruyne. Sergio Aguero was his usual ruthless self. He scored both goals and could have had more, but there was one other player who really caught my eye and that was Phil Foden. The England Under 17 World Cup winner stood out. His vision, his passing, his awareness, his coolness.  This 18-year-old is turning into a man on the pitch and this season I hope we’ll see more of him in that sky blue shirt. Even if it is in competitions outside the Premier League, I hope Guardiola puts his faith in him. How could he not after a performance like this? Sure, Chelsea had players missing but Foden still did himself no harm. City are already dominant in that central area of the pitch, but the teenager can now become an important player for Guardiola this season."
"Maurizio Sarri has backed Ross Barkley to play an important role at Chelsea this season after being impressed by the midfield's ability. Barkley struggled for playing time last season under Antonio Conte following his move from Everton in January, making just two Premier League appearances. Former Napoli coach Sarri's arrival at Stamford Bridge, however, has given the midfielder a fresh chance to impress - and he was handed a starting role in Sunday's Community Shield defeat by Manchester City alongside new signing Jorginho and Cesc Fabregas.    And after the match, Sarri insisted the midfielder will be part of his plans for the new season despite some concerns over his work off the ball. 'I like him, he said. 'He is a technical player.  'He has to improve on the defensive phase, it's difficult to play with Jorginho, Cesc and Ross all together. But I like him. He will be a very useful player for us.' Barkley completed the full 90 minutes at Wembley, but could not stop his side succumbing to a 2-0 defeat thanks to Sergio Aguero's double. He will now compete with the likes of Jorginho, Fabregas and N'Golo Kante for a place in Sarri's usual 4-3-3 system. Chelsea and Barkley face Lyon on Tuesday before starting the Premier League season away to Huddersfield on Saturday."
"Alvaro Morata was roundly criticised following Chelsea's disappointing Community Shield performance as they were well beaten by Manchester City. City won 2-0 and could have scored more, while Chelsea - spearheaded by the blunt Morata up front - offered little in response.  Morata was singled out by the pundits afterwards, with Sportsmail columnist Chris Sutton saying that the striker went missing when Blues manager Maurizio Sarri needed him most. Speaking on BT Sport, Sutton said: 'Sarri has hung his hat on Morata, and he just looked short of confidence again today. 'This is where you need your senior players to stand up and make a statement, and he went missing.' Former Manchester City defender Richard Dunne was also scathing of Morata, accusing him of being unwilling to work for the team.  He claimed Chelsea needed to look at bringing in another striker after Gonzalo Higuain turned them down in favour of AC Milan last week.  Dunne said: 'Sarri needs a centre forward, someone he can rely on up front. I don't see that in Morata, I don't see the desire to be a team player.' Rio Ferdinand was also unhappy with Morata, saying that the City defence would not have been concerned at any stage by the Chelsea attacker.  Ferdinand said: 'He didn't seem to have the heart for it, as if he was too interested. From a centre half's point of view he does not scare you. Unless you get the ball wide, he is not effective.' "
"From expensive summer signings to those returning after a standout World Cup, all eyes will be on the Premier League's big names when the new season kicks off. But which stars should you keep a particular eye on - and why?  Here, Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp picks the 10 players to watch, including Liverpool's midfield dynamo and a Fulham youngster looking to make his mark.  NABY KEITA, 26, LIVERPOOL  He's a little powerhouse — an all-action hero in midfield. Keita has a great touch, will make goals and score them. There is also devilment in his play and that could get him in trouble. We saw that last season when he was sent off four times. When Manchester United visit Anfield in December, I’m sure they’ll use every trick in the book to try to wind him up! But if he keeps his cool, he can be such an important player. The only time Liverpool missed Philippe Coutinho was against the more stubborn sides when they struggled to unlock the door. Keita and fellow arrival Fabinho can bring that guile to Jurgen Klopp’s midfield. MAX MEYER, 22, CRYSTAL PALACE Palace have committed a lot of money in terms of wages on the former Schalke star. I first saw him play against Chelsea in the Champions League five years ago. He is a neat and tidy player who is good on the ball but is yet to fulfil his true potential. At 22 there’s plenty of time for him to do so but whether he can at Selhurst Park remains to be seen. The big challenge for Roy Hodgson is how to use him. Will he sit in a midfield two or play as a No 10? I’m fascinated to see how this move turns out. AARON RAMSEY, 27, ARSENAL I'm expecting big things from Ramsey this season. Unai Emery must look at the midfielder and think, 'Why haven't Arsenal got the best from him?' What Emery has to do is give him more direction. There has been no pressure on any of the Arsenal players for the last few years under Arsene Wenger but now each will be given a defined role. Emery must tell Ramsey that his job is to make late runs into the box and score Frank Lampard-style goals. He has one year left on his contract and it is vital that Emery keeps him at the Emirates. Start the season in scintillating form and I can see Ramsey signing a new long-term deal. JORGINHO, 26, CHELSEA It is a good sign when a new manager’s first act upon arriving at a club is to bring in a player he has worked with closely. Maurizio Sarri rates £57million signing Jorginho highly and trusts him to be the pass master in Chelsea’s midfield. He has a lovely habit of finding a team-mate with practically every pass but he struggled against City at Wembley yesterday and will need to get up to speed quickly. If he does, Chelsea should have a great balance in midfield with Jorginho alonside N’Golo Kante. They have bundles of energy and will keep the ball well. RICHARLISON, 21, EVERTON When I first saw him play for Watford, he was the closest I have seen to a young Cristiano Ronaldo. I’m not saying that he’s as good as the five-time Champions League winner. But I see in Richarlison the same attributes the 19-year-old Ronaldo possessed when I played against him. The Brazilian has blistering pace, is good in the air and loves to take on players. At times he over-elaborates with his tricks and flicks and his critics will point to the fact that he did not score after November. But there is a reason Marco Silva - who brought him to Watford this time last year - has paid £44million to take him from his old club. That may seem a lot of money now but if Richarlison fulfils his potential, it could prove a bargain. Everton’s new manager knows that if he can dig beneath the surface, he can strike gold. RUBEN NEVES, 21, WOLVES This player is central to everything Wolves do. He was their outstanding player in their promotion campaign and I’m confident he will make the step up to the Premier League. Neves likes to dictate games from midfield but he may find it tricky at first. He will not be afforded the same space he was given in the Championship. He was a showman last season - scoring six times from outside of the box - and I am sure we will see more of those magic moments. Nuno Espirito Santo has built a strong squad at Molineux and I don’t think they will be in any danger of going down. Impress this season and Neves could be set for a big move. PHIL FODEN, 18, MANCHESTER CITY I really believe this kid can be the future of English football. At the World Cup we were crying out for a creative spark in midfield and I hope one day Foden can be that player. He and Mason Mount, who has joined Frank Lampard’s Derby on loan from Chelsea, are two of the brightest young prospects in England. Pep Guardiola has seen enough of Foden to want to develop him at City rather than send him on loan. This is a manager who has worked with the likes of Xavi and Iniesta and that bodes well for Foden. This may not be his breakthrough year — it will be hard to displace the midfield geniuses of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva — but I’d like to see him getting more game time. The FA Cup and League Cup could be perfect stages on which to shine. JACK WILSHERE, 26, WEST HAM James Corden is trying to claim the credit for Jack going to West Ham after he came on A League Of Their Own a few weeks ago! This is a perfect move for him. He is the sort of player who will take the game by the scruff of the neck and conjure moments of magic. The West Ham fans should really take to him. Of course there will be question marks over his fitness and I have said for a long time that he needs to add more goals and assists to his game. But if he can stay injury free he has a great platform to get back into the England squad. For me this is the most interesting signing of the summer and I’m intrigued to see how he does. PAUL POGBA, 25, MANCHESTER UNITED Pogba went to the World Cup with plenty of questions hanging over him. Can he do it in big games? Can he score goals? Can he be disciplined and play in a midfield two? It’s safe to say he answered every one of his critics as France were crowned world champions. Didier Deschamps, the France manager, found a way to get the best from him so why can’t Jose Mourinho? I just feel there is another clash waiting to happen between these two and I find it difficult to see how they can repair their relationship. Mourinho has gone with the safe option of making Antonio Valencia his captain but I’d have given the armband to Pogba. By building the team around him, Jose would be challenging Pogba to prove he is an elite player by delivering captain’s performances every week.   RYAN SESSEGNON, 18, FULHAM  What strikes me most about Sessegnon is that nothing seems to faze him. He is only 18 but has already played 71 games in the Championship, scored 20 goals and been shortlisted for PFA Young Player of the Year. When I first watched him at left back I thought that he could be the next Ashley Cole. Now, his transition to left wing reminds me of Gareth Bale. Manager Slavisa Jokanovic has recognised that a player with such pace and skill can cause more damage high up the pitch. I don’t want to put too much pressure on him but I cannot see why he won’t take to the Premier League with the same confidence he has approached his promising career to date.  "
"After the most thrilling and unpredictable World Cup many of us can remember, the Premier League faces an unusual and intriguing challenge. How on earth does it top that? Summers can seem long without the ebb and flow of domestic football. Wall to wall coverage of the Premier League means it has become if not quite the soundtrack to our sporting lives, certainly that friend that is always there for us. Maybe it has taken us for granted a little, knowing we will always be around. But on the back of the World Cup and England’s prominent role in it, maybe it is time for the Premier League to remind us again just what it was that made us fall for it in the first place. And if it can give us one thing this season, then that thing would be a genuine title race. It was impossible to call the outcome of the World Cup right until they were about to pull all the bunting down in Moscow. But last year wonderful, beguiling Manchester City had the title won by Christmas while the year before - strange as it sounds now - Chelsea were clear winners once Antonio Conte turned things around. In fact the last time the Premier League gave us a true fight to the finish was five seasons ago when Liverpool clipped the last hurdle to give Manuel Pellegrini’s City side victory by two points.  That is appropriate because if anybody looks ready to seriously challenge City this time round, then it looks like being the Merseyside club. Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side know what the standards are. City set them under Pep Guardiola last season and the champions are unlikely to slip far from that level over the next nine months.  Liverpool can match City on their day and often have done. The challenge now is to find the consistency to stand square with them over the course of a season. Jose Mourinho was just being Jose Mourinho last week when he suggested the pressure was on Klopp to deliver. The Manchester United boss had a point, though.  The sale of Philippe Coutinho — remember him? — has enabled Liverpool to back Klopp in the market this summer and as a result the Liverpool squad has a deeper, more solid look about it now. Liverpool will not lack motivation and nor will their manager. This could be a season that sees Chelsea and Arsenal in transition under new managers while United and Tottenham don’t look much stronger than they did last term. So this feels a little like a moment in time for Klopp and his players. Much will depend on the ability of a new goalkeeper — the Brazilian Alisson — to settle. During the World Cup, the former Roma player always looked a little too keen to punch rather than catch.  In midfield, meanwhile, Fabinho and Naby Keita will be required to offer their new club some reliability. As prosaic as it sounds, Liverpool cannot play as openly as they have under Klopp so far if they are to win things. However, Liverpool’s chances probably depend on a familiar face as much as any new arrivals and that face belongs to Mo Salah.  Last year’s Player of the Year will not score the 40-plus goals he did last year. That was a one-off, a magical mixture of perfect form and fitness. It was a season when the stars aligned for the Egyptian and if Liverpool are to leap from fourth to first and make up a 25-point gap on City then he must lead from the front again. City have added Riyad Mahrez to their squad and have numerous other players who we can expect to improve this time. Benjamin Mendy is fit again and John Stones and Kyle Walker will be better, more mature players thanks to their World Cup experience. Liverpool and the rest must also hope Guardiola will be distracted by Europe. City will not admit it but the Champions League remains the elephant in the room. Only a significant drop in standards at the Etihad will really give United, Arsenal and Chelsea a chance in the league while at Tottenham, Mauricio Pochettino will once again wrestle with the issue of how to get a marquee performance out of his gifted team when it really, really matters. Elsewhere, this could be the season when we find out whether new Everton manager Marco Silva can get a team to play for more than three or four months and whether West Ham have recruited a different Manuel Pellegrini to the one who spent much of his time at City giving off the distinct impression that he would rather be somewhere else if only he could be guaranteed the same amount of money. We welcome the return to the Premier League of one of Europe’s brightest and most interesting coaches in Slavisa Jokanovic and his Fulham side should prosper.  It is harder to be as optimistic for the other promoted teams Wolves and Cardiff, while it looks challenging at this juncture to expect anything but relative regression from teams like Burnley, Leicester, Huddersfield, Crystal Palace and, sadly, Newcastle United. Bournemouth and Brighton may continue to punch upwards at the Premier League’s glass ceiling simply because of the quality of the coaching at those clubs and it would be appropriate if that were to be the case. At the top of the Premier League, the story may be about a German and a Spaniard but the summer has changed the way we view things a little. If ever we should be in the mood to celebrate English management and English football, it is now. "
"Can anyone topple Manchester City? How will Arsenal fare in their brave new era? And will Jose Mourinho ever learn to love Paul Pogba? Fresh from the World Cup in Russia, Martin Keown and Chris Sutton debate the burning issues ahead of the new Premier League season.  Sportsmail's JAMES RESTALL asked the questions... KEOWN: Liverpool have City’s card marked. They were the first team to beat them in the Premier League and saw them off twice in Europe. What they lacked was the consistency to mount a title challenge but have spent a fortune to close their 25-point gap on City. I feel Jurgen Klopp is on a journey. I played against the Liverpool sides of the late Eighties and they would steamroller their opponents, particularly at Anfield. That is what Klopp’s teams do. I recently watched the excellent BBC documentary Shankly: Nature’s Fire. His teams played for the people and it is the same with Klopp. He is wired in to the emotion of the Merseyside fans. He has strengthened every compartment of his team. Andrew Robertson and Virgil van Dijk filled the gaps in defence. Now he has added quality in midfield with Naby Keita and Fabinho and spent a world-record fee for a goalkeeper. Toppling Pep Guardiola will take some doing but City’s goal will be to win the Champions League. So fierce is the competition that I cannot see one team winning both the league and European Cup. There is not the same pressure at Anfield. Maybe, just maybe, this could be their year. SUTTON: City won’t rack up 100 points but the title is staying at the Etihad. I just cannot look past their strength in depth. John Stones looked right at home at the World Cup and he ended the season as City’s fourth-choice centre back. Leroy Sane, one of their most lethal weapons, has had his feet up all summer. He’ll be desperate to show why Germany should have picked him. City’s football is breathtaking. Their players know what it feels like not just to be champions but to utterly dominate and Guardiola won’t take his foot off the pedal. Do Liverpool know how to beat City? Yes. Will their spending make it a tighter title race? Yes. Are they consistent enough to topple City? I’m not so sure. KEOWN: I wish someone could help Mourinho hold his tongue. He has invited this scrutiny by drawing attention to his team’s poor performances. It’s only pre-season! Arsenal beat PSG 5-1 but no one is saying they will be champions. Working for someone who is never satisfied is difficult. Mourinho’s personal quest for greatness seems to be suffocating his players. Pogba was excellent in the World Cup final but could have easily been dropped after a below-par display against Australia in the group stage. Didier Deschamps stuck by him, backed him and he grew through the tournament. From day one at Chelsea, Mourinho said Frank Lampard was a world beater - and he then started playing like one. United have a formidable group of players but Mourinho needs to learn how to love them. SUTTON: I said recently that if Jose Mourinho carries on with these outbursts, he is in danger of being out of a job before Christmas. Manchester United have gone from runners-up to complete turmoil. He’s been telling us that his side aren’t good enough, moaned about the lack of signings and risked upsetting Paul Pogba. How can anything positive come from this? United are the side most in danger of dropping out of the top four. If they get off to a bad start there will be more infighting, more moods, more outbursts and that is only going to end one way.  KEOWN: It may be all change but there will always be expectation. Unai Emery is a successful manager who is not here to finish fifth. I’m not saying they are ready for a title challenge but the top four has to be the objective. I’ve been impressed with Emery. He has worked his players hard in pre-season. Arsenal’s away form was embarrassing but they will have a better balance this year. They have a warrior in Sokratis while Lucas Torreira can bring bite to the midfield. Unlike their rivals, Arsenal only had one player in the World Cup semi-finals. City had seven. When they travel to the Emirates on Sunday the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Raheem Sterling may be unavailable. Arsenal will not have a better chance to beat the all-conquering champions. Do so, and they could steal a march on their rivals. SUTTON: The top four will be their goal but the Europa League may prove the more attractive route into the Champions League.  Emery won the competition three times with Sevilla, and Arsenal don’t look stronger than last season’s top four. Sixth is not good enough for this club. Even if they finish in that position again, the season will still be viewed as a success if performances improve. KEOWN: It will be a massive help. They don’t want to be at Wembley for any longer than they need to be. Opening the new ground against Liverpool will be great theatre. The stadium will have a galvanising effect on the club. SUTTON: Tottenham dropped just four points in their last season at White Hart Lane and this ground will become a similar fortress. The only thing I don’t get about the stadium is the microbrewery and artisan bakery. What’s wrong with a good old pie and pint? KEOWN: Managerial change is commonplace at Chelsea but after arriving with only a month to go until the start of the season, Maurizio Sarri has it all to do. Not only have his squad had little time to adapt to his 4-3-3 system, most of Chelsea’s World Cup stars have only just returned. Should it all click they will be mouthwatering to watch. Antonio Conte is a serial winner but his side had become too predictable. Sarri has huge experience but he’ll need to use all of it if Chelsea are to hit the ground running. SUTTON: Chelsea’s season hinges on Eden Hazard. He is so influential and Wilfried Zaha at Crystal Palace is the only player whose departure would be as damaging for one club. Hazard was unplayable at times last season. Should he leave, getting back into the top four will be an uphill struggle. Once again, Roman Abramovich will be expecting Chelsea to push but I cannot see Sarri having the same instant impact as Conte two years ago. KEOWN: If I was one of our World Cup stars, I would cut my holiday short. Stones had an excellent tournament but had only played twice for Manchester City since March. He faces stiff competition from Nicolas Otamendi, Aymeric Laporte and Vincent Kompany for a place. SUTTON: I saw Ruben Loftus-Cheek has already gone back to Chelsea. He knows it is on the training pitch where he can prove that he should be picked ahead of Jorginho, N’Golo Kante and Cesc Fabregas.  Managers will go for the players who they believe give them the best chance of winning. It’s up to the English players to show why they deserve to be selected. Which hot-shot will win the Golden Boot? KEOWN: Kane is the safe bet but don’t rule out Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He scored 10 in 13 after joining in January and posted similar figures to Kane in his last three years at Dortmund.  SUTTON: If Harry Kane stays fit it’s no contest. What makes him so difficult to face is that he is always one step ahead of the defenders. He now scores as many goals with his left foot as his right. I can’t see Mo Salah repeating last season’s extraordinary numbers. To remain as prolific then, like Kane, he must keep developing his game.  Finally... predict the top four  KEOWN: I’m going to put my neck on the line and say Liverpool to win it, followed by City, Spurs and United. But Arsenal and Chelsea can sneak in. SUTTON: City will win the title with Liverpool second. It’s too close to call between the next four but Tottenham will finish third and United fourth... just.  KEOWN 1. Liverpool 2. Manchester City 3. Tottenham 4. Manchester United   SUTTON 1. Manchester City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Manchester United "
"The transfer window is close to shutting and the new Premier League season is just days away - so what better time for some predictions? Will Manchester City retain the title? Who will be relegated? And can anyone stop Real Madrid winning the Champions League again? Sportsmail's experts answer those three questions and have their say on plenty more as we look forward to another huge campaign.   IAN LADYMAN Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea Relegated: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Leicester FA Cup: Manchester City League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Stoke, Swansea and Middlesbrough Champions League: Juventus Pep Guardiola said his team can't match last season's phenomenal effort but why not? City have added Riyad Mahrez and their players will be better for last year. Europe may distract them but their rivals have too much ground to make up. Liverpool will improve on the back of summer business but not enough to make up last season's 25-point gap. I've put Jurgen Klopp down for the League Cup because has to win a trophy some time. Hasn't he? Manchester United will not be as bad as people have suggested simply because they never are while Spurs will be this season's big surprise and not in a good way. They have not invested properly and could suffer because of it. It's a shock to include Leicester to go down but they have lost their best player and will they keep Harry Maguire and Peter Schmeichel? In the Championship, Stoke have done some decent summer business and hired a sound manager in Gary Rowett while Swansea appointed the bright and talented Graham Potter. Middlesbrough have Tony Pulis at the helm and nobody would bet against the 60-year-old doing what he does best. IAN HERBERT  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea Relegation: Huddersfield Town Brighton Cardiff City FA Cup: Manchester United League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Aston Villa, Stoke, Middlesbrough Champions League: Juventus Manchester City will dominate again because it is a season of transition for Chelsea and Arsenal while Manchester United, consumed by Jose Mourinho's relentless negativity, are flat-lining and better off without him. Liverpool will be stronger but their defence is still a weakness. Tottenham may struggle to keep happy that English core who could earn bigger money elsewhere. At the other end of the table, Huddersfield and Brighton both looked vulnerable last season. Aston Villa's new wealth will catapult them back. SAMI MOKBEL Champions: Liverpool Top four: Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle. FA Cup: Tottenham. League Cup: Arsenal Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Derby Champions League: Juventus Liverpool's squad is significantly stronger following their summer signings.. If Alisson can live up to his billing, Klopp's men can overcome City. If Chelsea strengthen, they could push Spurs for the top four. I expect Mauricio Pochettino to finally lift the trophy noose around his team's neck while any trophy will be a satisfactory first season for Unai Emery. And even with Rafa Benitez, I fear the Magpies' lack of investment will catch up with them this season. In Europe, who'd bet against Cristiano Ronaldo? DOMINIC KING Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Relegation: Bournemouth, Huddersfield, Cardiff  FA Cup: Liverpool  League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Aston Villa Champions League: Juventus City set an incredible standard last year and history says Pep Guardiola's teams improve with each year under his supervision. It won't be as straightforward as last season but they are the team to beat. There is an idea that Tottenham are vulnerable and could miss the top four but Chelsea and Arsenal both have the Europa League to contend with and that likely schedule of Thursday-Sunday in the jam-packed first half of the season will be crucial. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be wrong about Huddersfield but it is going to be a big struggle for them. MATT BARLOW  Champions: Manchester City  Top four: Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Bournemouth FA Cup: Chelsea League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Middlesbrough, Stoke, Aston Villa Champions League: Juventus No team has defended the title since Manchester United in 2009 but Manchester City were so far ahead last season, 19 points clear. They are settled with scope to improve and Guardiola has form for stacking titles once his team is the way he likes it. Unless there is a calamity around the corner, it is hard to see them collapsing, while those in pursuit have differing degrees of disruption to work through. RIATH AL-SAMARRAI  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Everton Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Leeds Champions League: Juventus City haven't added much but what they have brought in - Mahrez - has strengthened an already exceptional squad. There's no place for Manchester United in my top four - Mourinho has already sucked the life out of them. Arsenal will need time to adjust to regime change and Liverpool will excel now that they have a top goalkeeper.  Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham badly need a trophy and ought to go all out for the FA Cup. In Europe, I fancy that £100m buys you rather a lot when it's Cristiano Ronaldo. CRAIG HOPE  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Southampton FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Leeds Champions League: Juventus Even if Spurs and Liverpool improve, the gap to Manchester City is too great to reverse in one season, but I expect those two to be the nearest challengers.  Manchester United may well take fourth and a League Cup, but I fear another miserable season of listening to Jose Mourinho sully what should be a brilliant and exciting football club to follow. LAURIE WHITWELL  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton  FA Cup: Tottenham  League Cup: Liverpool  Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Leeds  Champions League: Manchester City This has all the hallmarks of a Mourinho meltdown season, meaning United missing out on Champions League, while Sarri should bring the fun back to Chelsea. Picking teams for relegation is tricky - but it feels like gravity might just get the better of three clubs punching above their weight. This is the season Pochettino and Klopp are rewarded with silverware in the cups. It is tough to look past Real Madrid for the biggie, but Guardiola might just get it right again. SIMON JONES  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Bournemouth, Fulham  FA Cup: Manchester United League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Middlesbrough Champions League: Manchester City City's race to the title will be closer run this season with Liverpool and Chelsea providing greater challenge. However, the addition of Riyad Mahrez plus the growing experience of their younger players will keep City ahead and capable of going all the way in Europe.  The summer investment from Stoke City and West Brom should see them make a swift return to the top flight. ADAM CRAFTON  Champions: Manchester City  Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal Relegation: Watford, Huddersfield, Cardiff FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Bristol City No side has defended the Premier League since Manchester United in 2009 and a decade on, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will prove themselves the greatest team since Sir Alex Ferguson's team of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.  At the bottom, Watford's high-turnover model will finally be caught out, Cardiff look too limited and Huddersfield will not be fuelled by the adrenalin of last season. JACK GAUGHAN Champions: Manchester City   Top four: Liverpool, United, Arsenal  Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton  FA Cup: Tottenham  League Cup: Liverpool  Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Middlesbrough   Champions League: Juventus  It'd be a huge achievement if Pep Guardiola became the first manager in a decade to defend the title but they have all the tools to do it. City must be wary of Liverpool though. After coming so close twice in four seasons, the capture of Cristiano Ronaldo might be enough to see Juventus go one better this time. It’d be Ronaldo’s fifth in six years if they pulled it off.  Another summer of struggling in the transfer market could take its toll on Tottenham, with Arsenal having enough to potentially edge them and Chelsea. Manchester United will finish in the top four providing they start well."
"Every Monday fans from each of the 20 Premier League clubs run the rule over their teams' performances in The Verdict. Here they analyse the season ahead. And none of them are tipping their team to go down! ARSENAL Peter Wood (Le Grove) BIGGEST HOPE: Unai Emery implements a distinct style of play that excites the fans and returns Arsenal the glory years of peak WengerBall. GREATEST FEAR: Emery doesn't adapt to the language, his ideas fall flat early on in the season, leading to #WengerIn protests in the stands. KEY PLAYER: Lucas Torreira. Our defence has lacked a shield for 10 years, this guy has the mobility, fire and discipline we need. He is a pivotal signing and could prove inspired. ONE TO WATCH: Smith Rowe looks an outside bet, but I think my money would be on defensive midfielder Guendouzi shining this season. His aggression, acceleration over 10-yards and his portfolio of passing stand him out as a hugely promising 19-year-old. GOOD WINDOW? It's been a required window. Not much glamour, but if you consider the acquisitions over the last eight months, we've replaced the entire spine. We've hired in know-how, experience and aggression. We're built to make the top four, and that's good enough. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Spurs in their new stadium, March 2. Would be special to trounce them. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 3rd at best, likely 4th. BOURNEMOUTH Peter Bell (Cherry Chimes) BIGGEST HOPE: I want to see AFC Bournemouth get to a cup semi-final or final. We have had several years of getting to quarter-finals and it would be great to get closer to a really big day out. GREATEST FEAR: It has to be relegation. Bournemouth have to work hard to retain their Premier League status and I'm a bit worried that the club has not made many signings. KEY PLAYER: Nathan Ake is the player who needs to play as many games as possible if Bournemouth are to keep the goals against down. I don't think the other players are anywhere near his level. ONE TO WATCH: We'll be expecting Lewis Cook to get more games and to start scoring some goals. He could break into teh England team with some good early season performances. GOOD WINDOW? The new signings are not big names and it is not clear whether they will be automatic starters. Fans haven't turned round at the signings and said wow that is an amazing signing for us. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Newcastle United is the game that is most on my mind as the weekend up in the North East is great fun with the Geordie fans who love football. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: Realistically, I'd settle for 14th. BRIGHTON Simon Cox (Brighton Fans) BIGGEST HOPE: Well, if I am allowed a 'biggest' hope, I'll take European football. Realistically, I would like to do the double over Palace and repeat or better last season's position. GREATEST FEAR: The only fear I have is losing Chris Hughton. The players are magnificent, but no individual is bigger than the sum of the parts. Our manager is our only MUST STAY! KEY PLAYER: Very hard to call this one, as Pascal Gross and Mat Ryan are both clearly men who quietly get on with doing a magnificent job, and none of the signings are 'superstars', so I will say Mat Ryan. The moment Krul turned up, Ryan became world class. ONE TO WATCH: Well, this will be controversial, but I love Ezequiel Schelotto. He is as mad as a box of frogs, but I believe he brings fun to the game, and he has the ability to cause mayhem! GOOD WINDOW? The proof of the pudding is always in the eating, but our scouts operate under the radar and unearth hidden gems. Ali Jahanbakhsh looks a good signing, and it will be enjoyable finding out who else we have discovered. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Simple. Fulham. It was my first ever away trip with my dad. We won. Paul Clarke goal. It was my first ever away trip with my son. We won. Nathan Jones fist pumps. Say no more. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: Top six! BURNLEY Tony Scholes (Up The Clarets) BIGGEST HOPE: Having finished 7th last season and kicked off this season with a Europa League game against Aberdeen, it would be demanding too much to expect anything better. My hope is that we can continue to build our club as a Premier League club. GREATEST FEAR: It has to be getting sucked into a relegation battle. We all but avoided it in 2016-17 and were a long way from it last season. I don't see it happening but we must be aware of it and ensure we stay well clear. KEY PLAYER: It's a team game at Burnley and so no player is ever more important than the next. If I had to pick any out then it would be the strikers simply because they score the goals that win games. ONE TO WATCH: There are a couple who have been involved in pre-season, central defender Jimmy Dunne and midfielder Dwight McNeil. Both have looked good and both look to have bright futures in the game. GOOD WINDOW? At the time of writing we haven't had a transfer window. We haven't bought anyone and we haven't sold anyone. I'm sure that will change in the next week though with maybe two or three new signings. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: The one I'm looking forward to is Spurs. It's always good to visit a new stadium and this one looks as though it is going to be worth a visit, unlike the last new stadium now used by West Ham. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 10th and that will be another good season. CARDIFF Callum Ellis (Inside Wales Sport)  BIGGEST HOPE: I hope we can remain competitive throughout the campaign and get a few positive results against the top six, just like we did in the 2013-14 season. GREATEST FEAR: After our last Premier League outing ended in relegation, the dreaded drop zone is my greatest fear again this season. KEY PLAYER: Captain Sean Morrison led by example last season and managed to score seven goals. He's a key figure in the heart of defence and always poses a threat from set-pieces. ONE TO WATCH: Rhys Healey has impressed in pre-season - and I'm sure he will be looking to challenge for a place in the matchday squad this season. GOOD WINDOW? Overall, it's been a good window with the four additions Neil Warnock has brought in. Josh Murphy and Bobby Reid are both exciting players who will hopefully deliver with goals. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: The opening day trip to the Vitality Stadium will be one each fan is looking forward to. Our long-awaited return to the top flight will bring a real buzz to the travelling Bluebirds making the trip to the south coast. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 16th CHELSEA Andy Seaby (Chelsea Daft) BIGGEST HOPE: Biggest hope is that Chelsea perform better than we did last season. Chelsea have made significant changes and they need to come off yet again. GREATEST FEAR: Biggest fear is that the new manager doesn't succeed and the decision to get rid of a serial winner in Conte for someone who has won nothing to date proves to be the wrong one. KEY PLAYER: Eden Hazard. We have to keep him at the club if we are to challenge for the top four once again. He has become so important for us now that to lose him could be devastating. ONE TO WATCH: Callum Hudson-Odoi, this kid has some serious talent, fantastic skill and excellent ability at such a young age. Whether or not he stays or gets loaned out, he could get involved at some stage this year. GOOD WINDOW? Bad in my view. Just one signing and Rob Green. The club acted too late to sort the managerial position out and could find themselves out of it when it comes to getting some big deals done if we lose one or two. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Manchester City because we need to banish the unprofessional and outright embarrassing performance there last season. We owe them and that's one I am looking forward to. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: Fourth in my view. If we can make a couple of signings and hold onto Eden Hazard we could aim higher. Its all down to how quickly the players take to Sarri-ball. CRYSTAL PALACE Jay Crame (The Eagles Beak) BIGGEST HOPE: A top 10 finish. We are probably a couple of signings away from having a competitive squad of players that would make a challenge for a top half spot but it bottom half of the table is likely to be as tight as it was for most of last season. GREATEST FEAR: The dreaded drop. While it is not the end of football that some may consider it to be, it would still be hard to take. It is never a nice feeling and we know that from experience. KEY PLAYER: Simple. Wilfried Zaha. We are not silly enough to think that he will not go on to bigger and better things at some point in the future but one more season in South London will be very welcome indeed. ONE TO WATCH: Tough question. Could say Aaron Wan-Bissaka will continue where he left of last season but if we are looking at a breakthrough player, it could be one of Sullay KaiKai, Jason Lokilo or Nya Kirby - if given the opportunity. GOOD WINDOW? The signing of Max Meyer is very exciting and something of a coup for us as he was touted by a nunmber of clubs. Do not underestimate the addition of Cheikhou Kouyate, either. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Fulham - not too far to travel for us of course and Craven Cottage is one those nicely positioned grounds, right by the Thames. There is no doubt that Roy Hodgson will receive a very good reception from the home fans. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 12th EVERTON Joel Parker (Toffee Analysis) BIGGEST HOPE: A good cup run and some actual ambition against the 'top clubs'. Far too passive when we face a better side away from home and it needs to be sorted. GREATEST FEAR: Falling back into last seasons troubles, lack of creativity, no organisation at the back... but surely you can't hit further than rock bottom, right? KEY PLAYER: Jordan Pickford - brilliant World Cup but he was the difference between a respectable league position and big, big trouble. ONE TO WATCH: Kieran Dowell - honestly one of the most dangerous left foots I've seen, great from dead ball situations, take-ons and can be a key creative link in Marco Silva's team. GOOD WINDOW? Bad - we haven't cleared enough of the deadwood as well as making any major signings who are guaranteed to do well. Richarlison does show promise but whether he can reach his £44m price tag is certainly debatable. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Always loved going to Craven Cottage. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 8th FULHAM Russ Goldman (Cottage Talk)  BIGGEST HOPE: My biggest hope for the season is that Fulham show the Premier League that they have come back to compete, and not just survive. My other hope is that they continue to play the attractive football they showed in the Championship. GREATEST FEAR: My greatest fear is that if they start slow, and the talk about sacking the manager begins. He is the right head coach for Fulham long term, so he could be put under pressure by the media and some fans, if Fulham do not get off to a great start. KEY PLAYER: It is Tom Cairney as the team really has been built around him. When Cairney is able to create opportunities for his team-mates, and himself, Fulham are a tough team to play against. ONE TO WATCH: I think it is a no brainer to say it is Ryan Sessegnon, and I expect him to show why he belongs to play in the Premier League right now. What makes him so dangerous is his football instinct to always be at the right place at the right time. GOOD WINDOW? So far it has been an excellent transfer window as Fulham are showing their intent to compete in this league, by the level of talent they have brought in already. The additions of Jean Michael Seri, and Andre Schurrle have shown the direction that Fulham want to go, and that is nowhere near the relegation positions. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: For this season, I am going to say it is going to be Wembley for Fulham supporters. It had been so long since Fulham have played at Wembley, so to get back there again is going to be special. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: I am going to be bold and say 10th, as the club has serious ambition, and I think Fulham's style of play will translate in the Premier League very well. HUDDERSFIELD Harry Greenwood (Better Than Klopp) BIGGEST HOPE: Our hope yet again has to be to survive, and hopefully more comfortably than last year. Anything beyond that is a bonus! GREATEST FEAR: The second season syndrome is always a fear. We've got a better squad than last year without a doubt, but we don't have the momentum of promotion anymore. KEY PLAYER: Terence Kongolo. He came in last year and contributed massively to us staying up. We've paid big money to keep him here, and he'll be crucial if we're to survive again. ONE TO WATCH: Abdelhamid Sabiri has looked really sharp in pre season. He's nowhere near the finished article but he's definitely made steps in the right direction. Philip Billing has improved further and new boy Diakhaby looks a good addition. GOOD WINDOW? It's been good again. We are maybe one or two players light, but we've bought well, bringing in young, hungry players. Wagner has addressed the problem area of the wing positions, and we've managed to offload a few. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Everyone is looking forward to Spurs and the new ground this year. Fulham and Cardiff coming up also adds two more good away days. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 15th LEICESTER Warwick Kay (LCFC World) BIGGEST HOPE: To reach the FA Cup final would be great. GREATEST FEAR: We could end up in a relegation battle if we don't hit the ground running. The fans would then get on Puel's back as the jury is still out on him - even though we finished 9th. We rely on Vardy a lot up front and without the service from Mahrez it will be interesting to see how he does. KEY PLAYER: This year it must be Harry Maguire! ONE TO WATCH: Hopefully Hamza Choudhury will continue growing after gaining experience last season. GOOD WINDOW? So far I'm happy with our transfers. We needed a new right back and Maddison looks an exciting prospect in midfield. Big shoes to fill with Mahrez leaving though. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Looking forward to seeing the brand new Spurs ground - looks good! WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: Top 10 again. LIVERPOOL Dave Usher (The Liverpool Way) BIGGEST HOPE: More of the same. Last year's performance level only with some silverware to show for it. GREATEST FEAR: I've got so much confidence in this manager and group of players that the only thing that worries me is if we have bad luck with injuries. KEY PLAYER: Roberto Firmino is the one who makes everything work. Mo Salah gets most of the headlines while Virgil Van Dijk's importance is widely recognised, but when Firmino is on song it makes life easier for everybody. ONE TO WATCH: Naby Keita. He's new to the Premier League and is relatively unknown outside of Liverpool as he was at an unfashionable club and represents a country that never plays at the World Cup. Those who don't know how good he is are in for a big shock. GOOD WINDOW? Its been great. The biggest need was addressed when Alisson Becker arrived. Keita is going to be a superstar, Fabinho should be an upgrade on Emre Can and it will be interesting to see how Xherdan Shaqiri does in a side where he doesn't have to do everything himself. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Everton. It's on our doorstep and it's funny seeing them fume about never being able to beat us regardless of how we play. Last year's fixture was a huge inconvenience for Jurgen Klopp as it was sandwiched between the two Man City games in Europe, but even with everyone's minds elsewhere Everton STILL couldn't win. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: Second, but if City were to suffer their usual post-title slump, then maybe… MANCHESTER CITY Steven Allweis (View From A Blue) BIGGEST HOPE: That City can produce the same attacking brilliance that made it so special to watch us last season. GREATEST FEAR: That we become a little complacent after breaking all those records last season and allow other teams to catch us. KEY PLAYER: Fernandinho. He is absolutely vital to Pep's system and the way we play, and we do not have anyone else who can play his role to a similar level. ONE TO WATCH: Phil Foden. We have seen glimpses of his potential so far and Pep will want to give him more opportunities, especially if we do not bring in other midfielders this window. GOOD WINDOW? Somewhere in the middle. Mahrez is a good signing, the lack of a new holding midfielder is not ideal ... but despite only bringing in one player we have to remember just how far ahead of the rest we were last year. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: A trip to the Brighton seaside for the last game of the season could be a fun celebration if the title is wrapped up by then! WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 1st MANCHESTER UNITED Sam Peoples (The Peoples Person) BIGGEST HOPE: Challenging for the title. At this point, United fans are worried we won't do that. GREATEST FEAR: Being out of the running by Christmas. KEY PLAYER: Pogba. World Cup winner and the catalyst to everything good we do. ONE TO WATCH: Lindelof. Underwhelming first season, had a great World Cup and Bailly needs a defensive partner. GOOD WINDOW? Bad. Fred is the only major signing who will make a difference. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Bournemouth. Love the stadium and the location WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 4th NEWCASTLE Tom Bore (Read Newcastle) BIGGEST HOPE: A cup run is always what fans, especially of those outside the top six, will be hoping for each season and I am no different. Success in either the League or FA Cup would be incredible. GREATEST FEAR: Relegation. Despite finishing tenth last season and signing a number of fresh faces this summer, it's hard to not be concerned about relegation - especially with Mike Ashley at the helm of the club who could force Rafa Benitez into leaving the club at any moment. KEY PLAYER: Club captain Jamaal Lascelles has to be our most important player. Not only is he our strongest player at the heart of the defence, but he is key in the dressing room to ensure the team's heads don't drop at any point this season. ONE TO WATCH: Jamie Sterry looks as if he will be featuring plenty for Newcastle this season. Whilst Adam Armstrong would typically be the man Newcastle fans highlight, Sterry deserves recognition for solid performances whilst progressing through the youth ranks. GOOD WINDOW? Many fans will disagree with me on this and I completely understand due to the money spent compared to our Premier League rivals, but I believe this window has been a success. We have improved on the squad we had last year, replacing any departing players with those that Rafa Benitez wanted and those that will fit the system he is looking to deploy. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Wolves. I have been desperate for a return ever since my last visit and am eagerly anticipating my trip to Molineux this season. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 10th-12th SOUTHAMPTON Sam Cox (Fresh Saints) BIGGEST HOPE: My hope for the season is that we can put last seasons failure of a campaign behind us and push for a top-half finish. Hopefully Mark Hughes can bring fast-paced attacking football back to St Mary's, following two underwhelming seasons under Claude Puel and Mauricio Pellegrino. GREATEST FEAR: Relegation. Southampton were one defeat to Swansea away from going down last season, due to a lack of freedom and creativity in the final third. Two months on and I'm still wondering where the goals are going to come from... KEY PLAYER: Jannik Vestergaard will prove to be Saints' most important player this season. Hughes paid £18m for the 6ft 6in centre back to provide the defensive stability that was non-existent last season. His physical approach to the game and natural ability on the ball will hopefully help to fill the Van Dijk shaped hole in our defence. ONE TO WATCH: Southampton are renowned for unearthing young talents and developing them into world stars. This season we may see the emergence of academy duo Josh Sims and Harrison Reed. Sims has shown glimpses of quality in an injury-plagued career so far, while Reed was a mainstay in Norwich's midfield last season, during a year-long loan spell at Carrow Road. GOOD WINDOW? Overall, I would have to say Saints' transfer window so far has been a success. We've strengthened in positions that let us down last season, invested in the future and thrown away the deadwood. The additions of Mohammed Elyounoussi and Jannik Vestergaard have been particularly pleasing. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: For Southampton fans, the best away trips are the two east and west of the South Coast to Bournemouth and Brighton. All three of us were fighting for League One promotion during the 2010-11 season, and our fixtures have been fiery ever since. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: I don't think Saints will be pulling up any trees this season and as a result I predict Saints to finish 11th. After last seasons relegation rollercoaster, I think most Saints fans will be happy with that. TOTTENHAM Barnaby Slater BIGGEST HOPE: I hope that we continue to improve as we have done over the past few seasons with Pochettino at the helm. How we take to our beautiful new stadium will be all important, but there's no reason why we shouldn't make it a fortress, seeing as we were hard to beat at Wembley where the atmosphere was average at best. A trophy would be fantastic, and in a strange way I think the Champions League may be our best chance of one as last season we showed that we can be a real force in that competition. GREATEST FEAR: A bad start as a result of our World Cup semi-finalists coming back late and tired, compounded by the need to play catch up for the rest of the season, something that would be near enough impossible, especially considering the amount of money our nearest challengers have spent over the summer to improve their squads. KEY PLAYER: Christian Eriksen. I know this will surprise many as Harry Kane is the obvious choice, but I genuinely feel Eriksen would be the hardest player for us to replace. He is our one player who can unlock the door and without him I worry where a lot of Harry Kane's chances would come from. ONE TO WATCH: As much as I'd like to say Marcus Edwards, it seems like his ship has sailed. Kyle Walker-Peters started two Premier League games last season and was Man of the Match in both. He has a real chance of becoming second choice LB/LWB behind Ben Davies if, as expected, Danny Rose departs this summer. I also feel he is less of a risk as reserve RB/RWB than Serge Aurier, who is still a bit too much of a maverick for my liking. GOOD WINDOW? Both so far. No money spent so far is winding up a lot of the Spurs fanbase. However, we need to ship out some of the deadwood in our squad such as Sissoko, Vincent Janssen and Fernando Llorente. On the plus side we've signed some of our most important players to new, long contracts - so that's a positive. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Arsenal. Time for us to beat them at the Emirates for just the second time. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: First, Second, Third or Fourth. If I were a betting man, which I am, I'd say third behind Man City and Liverpool. WATFORD David Anderson (Golden Pages Fanzine) BIGGEST HOPE: My biggest hope for the season is to see us continue to play well after Christmas. Every year since our promotion in 2015, we've started well but dropped off in the second half of the season. Hopefully we can have a stable full season under Javi Gracia and avoid this dip. GREATEST FEAR: More managerial instability would be my greatest fear, whether this be Gracia performing well and having his head turned, or him performing badly and his position being questioned. A full, stable season with one head coach in charge would be lovely. KEY PLAYER: Abdoulaye Doucoure, who has just signed a new five-year deal, will undoubtedly by a key player again this year in midfield. However, whether Doucoure stays or goes, the return of Nathaniel Chalobah from injury will be huge for us. ONE TO WATCH: Chalobah and Will Hughes are obvious answers, but new signing Ben Wilmot is really one to watch. He's impressed in pre-season since signing from Stevenage and it's nice to have a local lad pushing for a first team place. GOOD WINDOW? I would have to say good, so far. Losing Richarlison was a blow, but at £44m it was too good an offer to turn down. I'm more than happy with the permanent signing of Gerard Deulofeu to replace the Brazilian. Ben Foster returning also feels like a bit of a coup, and we've strengthened in depth with a few cheap signings in the wide areas too. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Fulham, without a doubt. Craven Cottage is full of character and in a lovely position right on the Thames. It's a pleasure to have them back in the top flight. Plus I have good memories there as a Watford fan, which certainly helps. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 15th WEST HAM Michael Oliver (Read West Ham) BIGGEST HOPE: As a West Ham fan, I try and keep as realistic as possible. You won't find me waxing lyrical about how we're going to mount a big charge on the European places, all I hope for is that the team can play an expressive, exciting style of football, which is something we have lacked for the last two seasons for the most part. With Manuel Pellegrini steering the ship and a slew of new signings all eager to impress, I hope that the team will finish comfortably in the top half. GREATEST FEAR: I suppose the fear with spending nigh on £100m on new recruits this summer already is that they fail to live up to expectations. While all new additions have made names for themselves either abroad or in the lower leagues, with the exception of Jack Wilshere and Lukasz Fabianski, none of them have Premier League experience and it's always a worry whether or not they can adapt to our game. KEY PLAYER: The club-record signing of Felipe Anderson from Lazio immediately makes the Brazilian our most important player heading into the new campaign. The exciting winger comes with great expectation to finally fill the void left by Dimitri Payet some 18 months ago. His playmaking ability in the final third is key to our progression under Pellegrini. ONE TO WATCH: Following last season's breakout campaign, Declan Rice will be looking to move from strength to strengthen and further establish himself as a first-team regular going forward. Despite signing two new centre-backs, West Ham see a bright future for Rice who could see some more playing time as a holding midfielder this season given the rearguard investment and subsequent failure to recruit an experienced holding midfielder thus far this summer. GOOD WINDOW? It's been nothing short of an excellent transfer window for the Hammers. Seven new additions so far and no major departures. Manuel Pellegrini and Mario Husillos appear to be on the same page when it comes to identifying potential signings and squad evaluation. One or two players will be moved on and one or two more will be brought in, but the squad is in a very good place. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: From a fans perspective, I relish the opportunity to travel to any and all away games, but there are a handful I have earmarked personally. Visiting new grounds is always something I look to do, and after being unable to go there last season, trips to Brighton and Huddersfield are both on the agenda this season. The best away trip I've been to would be Liverpool, but as you would expect, it's all heavily dependent on the result. I look forward to being at Anfield on that opening Sunday. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: The minimum expectation is a top half finish this season. I think the top six is a step to far at least for this season, but I look around at the other clubs in that tier below, and I strongly believe that in Manuel Pellegrini, West Ham have the best and most experienced manager outside of the top six, and a squad to rival anyone elses. I think eighth is a realistic projection for this season. WOLVES Ben Husband (Wolves Fancast) BIGGEST HOPE: That the team continue exactly where they left off last year. Nuno's Wolves adapted to the Championship like a duck to water and all at Molineux will be hoping they do the same to the Premier League. GREATEST FEAR: That some of Europe's elite really take notice of what could be happening at Wolves and take some of our prized assets both on the field and in the dugout. KEY PLAYER: Willy Boly - although Ruben Neves rightfully gains a lot of the plaudits, Wolves' promotion was built from the back. Nobody bettered the 24 clean sheets achieved and the tall French defender was integral to that success. ONE TO WATCH: Ruben Vinagre - heads were turned when assist machine Barry Douglas was sold to Leeds, but the young Portuguese left back has a huge future ahead of him and will now look to make a name for himself up against some of Europe's elite. GOOD WINDOW? This has been a summer of evolution rather than revolution. Much of the business has been to tie last season's loan players on permanent deals and with the signings of internationals like Rui Patricio and Joao Moutinho, this summer can be seen as a massive success. AWAY TRIP YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO: Spurs - its a new ground for all fans to tick off and Wolves have had some happy memories away to Tottenham and they will be hoping to make some more in their luxurious new home. WHERE WILL YOU FINISH: 8th"
"It is the sort of scenario they may well present to a budding manager during assessment for his coaching badges - what to do if your team is reduced to 10 men after less than quarter of an hour? Oh, and it's your first ever league game. And it's away from home. This, however, was far from the comfort of the classroom for Steven Gerrard. At a partisan Pittodrie, this was for real. The former Liverpool and England captain thought he had the answer - put your two pacey wingers through the middle, play on the counter-attack, nick a goal, defend your lead and escape back to Glasgow with an opening-day victory. And how close the rookie boss was to emerging with top marks. Indeed, Aberdeen's first shot on target did not arrive until the 92nd minute - it just so happened to find the bottom corner via the boot of a teenage debutant who had not read the script.  For Gerrard, after impressively negotiating two Europa League qualifiers in recent weeks, this was his first setback. Interestingly - and somewhat surprisingly - he did not react to it with the good grace you would expect of an individual so intelligent and considered. By the time he came to reflect, the club tie which had completed his suited ensemble had been ditched. Perhaps he had used it in an attempt to string up the referee and his assistants, for they were the source of his ire. Yes, his frustrations were not entirely without justification, but to suggest a wider conspiracy against his new club after his first Scottish Premiership match in charge match was baffling and deflected from his team's courageous performance. 'It's not just today, it's been happening for a good while,' said Gerrard. 'I believe it's been happening for seasons, I've watched footage. I don't think we ever get anything to go for us. So someone should give me answers on that.'  Aberdeen (4-3-3): Lewis; Ball, Devlin, McKenna (Forrester 31), Consie; Gleeson (May 52), Shinnie (c), Ferguson; McGinn, Cosgrove (Anderson 71), Mackay-Steven Subs not used: Cerny (GK); Wright, Campbell, Harrington Scorer: Anderson 90+3  Booked: Ferguson, Devlin, Forrester Rangers (4-4-2): McGregor; Tavernier (c), Katic, Goldson, Flanagan; Arfield, Jack (Ejaria 82), Coulibaly, Murphy (Kent 70); Windass, Morelos Subs not used: McCrorie (GK); Umar, Halliday, Candeias, Alnwick Scorer: Tavernier pen 30 Booked: Arfield, Goldson Sent off: Morelos 12 Referee: Kevin Clancy  Attendance: 19,046  Why was he so angry? Well, we were only 12 minutes in when his striker Alfredo Morelos was sent off for kicking out at defender Scott McKenna. Gerrard had spoken just last week about the suspect temperament of the Colombian, vowing to 'fix' his fragile mindset. The manager should be wondering if his words even went in one ear, let alone out the other. For while the social-media hot-take was that the dismissal was harsh, it was still the correct call. On no page do the Laws of the Game state that you are allowed to kick an opponent (as long as it's not too vicious). Morelos was stupid and deserved to go. Gerrard saw it differently and referenced the provocation of the 22-year-old by McKenna, whose actions were deliberate and scheming, yes, but not worthy of a red card. 'We feel hard done by because we felt he was provoked twice with violent barges,' said Gerrard. 'No way in the world was his kick out violent. So we didn't think he deserved a red.' Gerrard wasn't done there with the officials. After reshuffling his team and pairing wingers Josh Windass and Jamie Murphy in attack, the clear instruction was to drop balls in behind centre-backs McKenna and Michael Devlin, whose turning speeds were akin to one of those nearby North Sea oil tankers. How satisfied Gerrard must have been, then, when his side were awarded a penalty on the half hour after breaching Aberdeen's static backline before Windass was tugged to the ground by Dominic Ball.  'There was no attempt to play the ball. So it's beyond me how a card can't be shown for that situation.' said Gerrard. Was he right? Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes did not think so and opinion among observers was split, too. Either way, captain James Tavernier scored from 12 yards and Gerrard allowed himself a discrete fist-pump - after events of the first 30 minutes he could take nothing for granted. And so it proved when 19-year-old Bruce Anderson smashed beyond Allan McGregor from inside the penalty area in injury-time. That was the afternoon's big injustice - not the refereeing - and Gerrard rightly reflected: 'I thought we were better than Aberdeen with 11 men and 10. We looked like the team with all the ideas, we looked like we wanted to play the right way. 'Tactically we were spot on for the majority of the game. So I don't go away from here sad, I actually loved what I saw.' There wasn't much love for the officials, however.   "
"Former Rangers player Nacho Novo has been filmed confronting a Celtic fan who subjected him to vile abuse as he arrived at Belfast Airport. The 39-year-old Novo, who played 255 times for Rangers between 2004 and 2010, was walking through the airport when the man, wearing a Celtic jacket, starting singing: 'Hope you die in your sleep, Nacho Novo.' Initially, the Ibrox favourite laughed off the chant, which the fan filmed, but then Novo decided to confront the man outside the airport terminal. The Spaniard squared up to the man and said: 'Why do you respect me like that? What have I f****** done to you? Have I done anything to you? What the f*** man?' before walking away. The Celtic fan's chant comes after  Novo suffered a heart attack while playing for a Rangers legends team in a tournament in Berlin back in January. Novo later tweeted about the confrontation, saying: 'Arrived at Belfast international airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide, as soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like (to) thank genuine Celtic supporter.' Novo also retweeted a video of the confrontation, leading to a flood of comments supporting him and condemning the actions of the Celtic fan. One user said: 'Unfortunately we don't live in an ideal world so men have to stand their ground when things like this happen. Any man would of (sic) done the exact same thing. Especially when it's a group of thugs who would jump on any weakness shown. Nacho dealt with it brilliantly.' Another wrote: 'That's bang out of order. Football rivalries don't justify you singing about people dying. Think Novo did well not to give him a smack in the mouth.' One Celtic fan posted: 'Disgraceful. Keep up the work of supporting the community and both sides.' Novo owns a bar, NN10, outside Ibrox and the player offered to pay a share of the drinks bill during 'Nacho Hour' ahead of the club's opening Scottish Premiership match against Aberdeen on Sunday.  "
"Steven Gerrard has claimed Scotland's under-fire referees have had it in for Rangers for years. The former England captain was denied his first league win as Ibrox boss after 19-year-old Aberdeen substitute Bruce Anderson claimed a dramatic equaliser in the 92nd minute. Insisting Rangers proved themselves a better side than their opponents, Gerrard rounded on referee Kevin Clancy for showing a red card to hothead striker Alfredo Morelos after just 12 minutes. He then slammed the referee for failing to punish Dominic Ball for the spot kick from which James Tavernier claimed the game's opening goal in 30 minutes. Claiming 'the world was against us today' Gerrard claimed the Ibrox side had been the persistent victims of poor decisions by referees over a lengthy period saying: 'It's not just today, it's been happening for a while. 'It's been happening for a good while. I believe it's been happening for seasons. That's my opinion, just my opinion. 'I've watched footage, yeah. Look, I don't think we ever get anything to go for us. Everything we have seen today is about Rangers So someone should give me answers on that. 'Someone should give me the answers because if there's anyone in his room thinks nothing should have happened after our penalty.' Asked if he planned to raise the issue with the SFA Gerrard shrugged: 'It is what is is. I can't control if the issue is going to be ongoing. All I can do is give my opinion on it.' Morelos was shown an early red card after kicking out following a barge by Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna. 'I think when you do stuff like that, when you react like that, you leave officials with decisions to make,' acknowledged the Rangers boss. 'So we will speak to him about the part he has played in it. But we feel hard done by because we felt Alfredo was provoked twice with violent barges. No way in the world was his kick out violent. So we didn't think he deserved a red. 'At the same time, with the penalty there was no attempt to play the ball.. So it's beyond me how a card can't be shown for that situation. 'The rules state that if you don't make an attempt to play the ball, you should be punished. There was no punishment. I had a chat with the ref. 'The assistant said he only saw one second out of the three with the Alfredo incident, which I find hard to believe. 'There are always emotions straight after the game. We've got a long journey back to reflect and decide on it. It seems like the world is against us today. But we'll make sure we get better for that. 'We'll make sure we play better and try and put results to bed, because it looks like some more decisions will go against us as the season goes on.' Motionless when Morelos was sent off after 12 minutes, the former Liverpool and England captain approached the officials for an explanation after the game. Asked if opponents were targeting the temperamental Colombian in a quest to have him sent off he added: 'Possibly. So he needs to learn and be ready for that. 'I can't prove that's the case but two violent barges by McKenna, it seems people are out to wind him up, yeah. 'What's disappointing from our point of view is that the whole incident was two or three seconds but the assistant only saw one second of it. 'So he sees Alfredo's instant in one second but not the two barges in the other two seconds.' Delighted with his team's display after they bounced back from the Morelos red card by restricting Aberdeen to scraps, Gerrard claimed: 'I thought we were better than Aberdeen with 11 men and better than them with 10 men.  'We looked like the team with all the ideas, we looked like we wanted to play the game the right way. 'It's a shame we are not going away with three points but I've got nothing bad to say about any of my players. I'm absolutely delighted with them.' Sportsmail understands Bournemouth's Jack Simpson will become Gerrard's eleventh signing of the season this week, with the 20-year-old left-sided defender poised to sign a season-long loan deal. 'I've got no comment on players. I would rather talk about my players today who I am really proud of - they were absolutely brilliant. Players we are linked with all seem to be getting in the media - that's a concern for me.'"
"Steven Gerrard has claimed Rangers were on another level compared to Aberdeen despite seeing his side concede a stoppage time equaliser at Pittodrie. Gerrard was taking charge of his first Scottish Premiership match in which Rangers led until the third minute of time added on following James Tavernier's 30th minute penalty. Aberdeen's goal came with their only shot on target through Bruce Anderson and they struggled throughout the game to break down the Gers despite Alfredo Morelos' straight red card in the 12th minute. ‘We were magnificent, we were very good with 11 men even better with 10,' Gerrard told Sky Sports, 'Aberdeen had no idea against us. For 93 minutes it was perfect, I am gutted for my players to concede so late on. Today we showed we are a class above Aberdeen. Every single player to a man was fantastic. ‘Aberdeen's only idea was to lump it in the box, I'm delighted with my players I don't go away from here disappointed. I thought they were tremendous. 'I thought we were better with 10 men so at half-time I said to them ""carry on what you are doing"". With a better final pass on two or three occasions we could have had another goal. Anyone watching must know we were better than Aberdeen today.' Gerrard refused to rule out whether Rangers would consider appealing Morelos' red card, where after two shoulder barges from Scott McKenna the forward kicked out at his opponent in frustration. The Rangers boss hinted Morelos was naive in leaving the match official to make a big call and admitted he would share a discussion with the forward regarding his hot-headed actions in private after the game. However Gerrard questioned why the earlier barges from McKenna were not penalised in the moments leading up to the sending off. ‘You leave the referee with a decision if you kick out but the disappointing thing from our point of view is he has been barged twice quite clearly,' Gerrard added. 'Whoever spotted the red card has not spotted the two clear barges by McKenna before it. There was major provocation before it. 'We will take our time, we will breathe, take the emotion out of it then we will make decision [on appealing sending off].'  "
"Steven Gerrard will have walked into Pittodrie on Sunday morning expecting a really difficult test. By the time he left a few hours later he must have been thinking: 'What was all the fuss about?' On the evidence of what we saw, Rangers will cruise past Aberdeen into second place this season. They were so comfortable - even with 10 men. In the first 10 minutes, Ryan Jack was the orchestrator, in the way Scott Brown does for Celtic. Then came the red card for Alfredo Morelos and, suddenly, we were watching the first major examination of Gerrard's credentials as a manager. He tweaked things to play without a striker, stay solid and hit Aberdeen on the counter, which they did to good effect. Gerrard got the better of Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes. In his first real test as Rangers manager, he passed with flying colours. But I'm not sure about what he had to say after the game. Does he honestly think referees have a vendetta against his club and his players? It's nonsense. Talking about incidents in the past is irrelevant. It's the here and now that matters - and you can't have a player going around kicking people. That's what Morelos did and he was rightly sent off. It wasn't a bad decision. Okay, it was a bit soft but the Colombian gave the officials a decision to make. Gerrard has gone from being a player, to a pundit, and now to a manager in the space of 18 months. He might have made those kind of comments as a pundit, but he wouldn't have made them as a player. And he shouldn't be making them as manager of Rangers, it doesn't reflect well. He is picking a fight he doesn't need to pick after a game in which his team played really well. You need hard evidence to back up comments like that. You can't just go around making wild accusations. It's wide of the mark to suggest referees have it in for Rangers - or any other team, for that matter. He is a new manager, at a new club, with lots of new players - he should be focusing on the future. Celtic aren't talking about the Invincible Treble a couple of seasons ago. They are talking about trying to qualify for the Champions League. Gerrard said afterwards that he was delighted with his players and that they played the perfect game - that should have been the story of the day. But the back pages on Monday morning will be covered with what he said about referees and the implication that there is an agenda against Rangers. It's ridiculous. They were down to 10 men for almost 80 minutes but were so solid that they limited Aberdeen to just one real effort at goal. Other than that, Allan McGregor didn't have to make a single save. That highlighted how poor Aberdeen were on the day. Gerrard is a smart guy. He will know the Dons have finished second for the past four years in a row - and only nine points behind a dominant Celtic team last season. On the evidence of Sunday, he'll be thinking: 'You know what - we have a real chance here if we can keep progressing in this manner'. Listening to what Gerrard and the Rangers players said in their post-match interviews, you could sense their belief. It was a case of: 'We are better than Aberdeen -plain and simple'. And it showed. The Dons were really poor. They looked a bit leggy having gone to extra-time at Burnley in midweek. But that's no excuse. The top sides can pick themselves up and go again when it comes to balancing European football and the league, Celtic have done it for years. McInnes will know the enormity of the job he has on his hands this season in terms of maintaining the level they have been at over previous years. They still have a lot of work to do in terms of recruitment and I would love to see Louis Moult back in the Premiership. McInnes tried to sign him from Motherwell last summer and he is the type of striker who could make a real difference. If Aberdeen really want to be competitive, they need to bring in someone who is going to get them around 20 goals a season. The same things keep cropping up with Alfredo Morelos. We know he can score goals. But, a lot of the time, it's his attitude, petulance and immaturity that ends up being the talking point. He is still just 22, but you can take a lot from what Pedro Caixinha said about him last season. Caixinha basically made the point that, if he was an opposition manager or player, he would do everything he possibly could to wind Morelos up and get under his skin. Everyone will be encouraged to have a go at him - because they know the red mist can fall at any moment and he'll lash out. That's what happened on Sunday It wasn't a case of the referee sending him off - it was Morelos who got himself sent off by kicking out. Scott McKenna had a little go at him. But so what? It's part and parcel of the game and you have to learn to deal with it. You are going to get physical contact and a bit of needle with defenders - but you can't just go around kicking them. Morelos needs to get his head straight and start focusing on scoring goals because we saw last season that he is really talented. Some people were saying that this could be the end for him at Rangers after what happened on Sunday but it's too premature for that. Steven Gerrard obviously feels like it was harsh and he will try to put an arm around him and protect him. If I was a player and I had someone like Gerrard sitting me down, having a chat and telling me to do something - that's exactly what I'm going to do in the next game. If he listens to his manager, Morelos could be a top player for Rangers. If he doesn't, he'll spend a lot of time suspended in the stand, which is absolutely no use to them. Celtic have a tricky tie against AEK Athens. I always preferred to play the second leg of these European games at home. It gave you an extra edge, knowing what you need to do. Celtic look like they are in a really good place in terms of their mentality and how they approach games. The only worry is this will be a huge test for the young guys in the back four - certainly a massive step up from Rosenborg. Kristoffer Ajer and Jack Hendry are clearly good players with huge potential but they will be tested to their maximum. Athens are a decent side. They reached the last 32 of last season's Europa League - and drew 0-0 with AC Milan in the San Siro along the way. Going to Greece next week in need of a result might be a big ask given the away record in recent years.  So Celtic need to really blow them away in the first leg in Glasgow - which they are fully capable of if they produce their best football."
"Those hunting for the effect of Marcelo Bielsa on Sunday would have been best serving standing behind the stand named after John Charles over three hours before kick-off. Leeds supporters were already beginning to line that narrow lane. Anticipation building, excitement growing. When it came to Bielsa’s team actually turning up, hundreds were roaring. They draped over barriers fashioning a corridor to the stadium’s reception, clambering up a stairwell to catch a glimpse. It was loud; Leeds loud. Leeds (4-4-1-1): Peacock-Farrell 6.5, Ayling 6, Berardi 6.5, Cooper 7.5, Douglas 7; Hernandez 7, Klich 7.5 (Dallas 76), Phillips 7, Alioski 7.5 (Harrison 89); Saiz 8 (Baker 88); Roofe 7.5 Subs not used: Bamford, Roberts, Jansson, Blackman. Scorers: Klich 15, Hernandez 45+1, Cooper 57 Stoke (4-5-1): Butland 5; Bauer 5, Shawcross 5, Martins Indi 6, Pieters 6; Ince 6.5, Etebo 5 (Fletcher 63, 6), Allen 6, Badou 5.5 (Bojan 63, 6), McClean 6.5; Afobe 6.5 (Crouch 76)  Subs not used: Williams, Diouf, Edwards, Federici. Scorers: Afobe pen 52  Referee:  Scott Duncan Attendance: 34,126 Bielsa has captured the imagination of this city and that has never been more obvious than the ferocity in an organic reception to their Tynedale coach trundling around one corner of Elland Road. It has been quite some time since a Leeds team sparked this sort of electricity. Their team – certainly not at full strength - produced in style, pummelling Stoke City into submission with tigerish intent. Gary Rowett admitted they were incapable of dealing with the fierceness of Bielsa’s midfield, who owned a relentless appetite to run that pointed to those triple training sessions paying off. In the short-term, anyway. There are detractors who believe the Argentine might well run this relatively small squad into the ground. Whether he manages to maintain these levels is all part of the intrigue but there is no denying that this was a very enthusing start indeed. Three goals, scored by Mateusz Klich, Pablo Hernandez and Liam Copper, were no more than Leeds deserved. Bielsa, perched on the top of a bucket turned upside down, remained motionless through each celebration. Yet his head must have been dizzying by the end of a rousing afternoon, forgetting to shake Rowett’s hand. Rowett, it must be said, did not see the harm. ‘The atmosphere was even bigger than what I thought,’ Bielsa said. ‘The fans were connected to our message in every second of the game. ‘My team took risks when moving the ball. Our players were very ambitious and they put in a great physical effort.’ What must the owner, Andrea Radrizzani, think of the big-top circus? It will not have gone unnoticed that Bielsa, a slave to homework, sussed Stoke out before this had even started, targeting a channel between Ryan Shawcross and Moritz Bauer on their right. The majority of home chances came from that area, including Klich’s 15th-minute opener, the product of an exquisitely tenacious run and slip by Samuel Saiz. Radrizzani might, though, take even more pleasure by the scenes outside. He arrived seconds before the Leeds coach, treated like royalty when swarmed by camera phones and flanked by three aids. One of those aids shot a video of the scenes for a keepsake. Radrizzani headed straight for the pitch, chatting to several players. They were even chattier afterwards. The second, right on half-time, was gifted to them by Jack Butland, palming Hernandez’s speculative effort into his own right-hand corner. Liam Cooper’s 57th-minute third, a thumping header from Barry Douglas’s wicked corner, was too easy. ‘We made it more difficult with basic mistakes,’ Rowett said. ‘All three were all poor reactions to losing the ball or a set-piece. ‘One or two of the players were surprised by the intensity and didn’t do their jobs properly enough. That was nowhere near the standard required to do well in this division.’ Rowett could be forgiven for feeling further infuriation that Cooper’s goal came just minutes after a penalty, netted by Benik Afobe, that briefly offered them surprising hope. Tom Ince rattled the bar too and there was a late flurry but the new manager knew this was not quite good enough. Bielsa, meanwhile, refused to make any proclamations about their prospects. The 63-year-old was somewhat agitated by this not being an absolute perfect performance. ‘Our team has to improve,’ he added. ‘We didn’t try to link defence and attack on the ground by the end. We challenged for the ball, we didn’t move it as good as we wanted. We couldn’t get the ball back. ‘For some moments (I was happy), yes. In other moments, no. We gave the ball away, played too close to our goal.’ That came via his translator Salim Lamrani, who also is key in delivering messages during training at Thorp Arch. You sense Lamrani could be hoarse this week, despite these stirring beginnings. The quest for crazy perfection continues."
"Marcelo Bielsa could not have asked for a better start to his new life in the Championship  as Leeds brushed aside newly-relegated Stoke 3-1 at Elland Road on Sunday. Goals from Mateusz Klich, Pablo Hernandez and Liam Cooper fired the Argentinian to victory but it was his incredibly awkward pre and post-match press conferences that left audiences perplexed. Still getting to grips with the English language, Bielsa required a translator  by his side when asked for his thoughts on the game in a rare post-match interview from the 63-year-old. What would follow was entirely bizarre. The Sky Sports interviewer began each question by asking Bielsa in English. His translator would then relay the message to the manager in his native Spanish. Bielsa would then give his answer to the translator in Spanish before his aide then told him how to provide a response in English. He then repeated it back to the interviewer to complete the strange process. Bielsa was pleased with his team's performance after his long-awaited debut in English football proved to be a resounding success.  He said: 'The physical effort of the players, the productivity of the players was pretty high.  'Our offensive actions were very good in some moments. It's a dynamic team, an offensive team and it is a team that dares to play. 'My team took risks when they were moving the ball so these are the positive aspects. But we lacked a bit of experience at the end of the game.  'Our team has to improve. At the end of the game we didn't try to link defence and attack playing on the ground. 'We challenged many times for the ball with the opponent and didn't move the ball as well as we wanted. 'At the end of the game we could not get the ball back off the opponent in our half so they are all aspects we need to correct.'  Fans on social media were quick to jump on the awkwardness of the situation though after the translator got uncomfortably close to the manager's ear when plotting a response. 'That Marco Bielsa post match interview was well awkward. The interpreter was chewing on his ear,' wrote @colpep87. @John_MooreMOT added: 'Credit to Bielsa, working extremely hard to give a pot match interview, insisting on speaking in English with the aid of a translator. Apparently his first post match interview straight after a match in 20 years. Confirms the respect he has for Leeds.' "
"Marcelo Bielsa got off to a winning start as Leeds manager as his side beat Stoke 3-1 at Elland Road on Sunday, with Mateusz Klich, Pablo Hernandez and Liam Cooper all on the scoresheet. Here's a look at Bielsa's actions in the dugout during his first game in charge. Pre-match: Couldn’t keep still and Bielsa pirouetted three drink holders on countless occasions as he checked on all four sides of Elland Road to take in the atmosphere. 5min: Spent the opening moments of the game sitting on a bucket turned upside down in his technical area, swivelling with the movement of play. 15min: Absolutely no reaction to the opening goal. Sat motionless. 33min: Still on the bucket, Bielsa briefly gesticulated frustration at Luke Ayling’s misplaced pass through midfield with Stoke caught square. 38min: Slapped his hands on his knees as Ayling aimlessly thumped possession out of play. 45min: Up off his perch for the first time, screaming at goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell to release the ball earlier. 60min: Barking instructions on his feet and discussing what changes to make before resuming a position on his bucket. 85min: Tiptoed right on the edge of his technical area as Leeds fought to clear from a set piece. 90min: Worriedly checking his watch as Stoke forced a late corner. Full time: Headed straight down the tunnel without shaking Gary Rowett’s hand. ‘I’ve got no problem with that whatsoever,’ said Rowett."
"Willian has insisted he is happy to remain at Chelsea this summer despite interest from Real Madrid. The Brazilian winger returned to action for Chelsea on Sunday, appearing as a substitute during their 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the Community Shield. It followed a late return to the club for pre-season training due to problems with his passport. Spanish giants Real Madrid are keen on him, as are Manchester United, but Willian is not looking beyond a stay at Stamford Bridge.  Speaking after the game, he said: 'I'm happy here, I'm happy at Chelsea to play here. I'm looking forward to playing well and to win titles.'  His inclusion came after just three days of pre-season training under new manager Maurizio Sarri. And Willian believes the action will benefit him over the course of the season after getting 35 minutes under his belt at Wembley. 'I feel good,' he continued. 'I feel good after three days of training, of course I am not my best performance, my best condition.  'But to play this kind of games is very important and I play, I think, 35 minutes which is good for me to keep improving.  'And we have to look forward because we have a great season to play and we're going to try to win some titles.  'We have to learn in every game, not only this game, of course we want to win but we didn't so now we have to keep going.  'We have a new manager with a new philosophy, a new profile of football so I have to keep going and try to train hard every day.'"
"Jose Mourinho believes his Manchester United team had nothing more to give as they ended their pre-season with a narrow defeat by Bayern Munich. United were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, five days before their Premier League campaign begins at home to Leicester. Manager Mourinho, without some key players due to their involvement at the World Cup, including Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard, brought on academy prospects James Garner, Axel Tuanzebe, Tahith Chong and Demetri Mitchell during the second half. At full-time, the Portuguese compared his youthful team to the raft of talent at Bayern's disposal, including experienced players such as Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben. 'Finally, it's over. Finally, such a difficult pre-season is over,' Mourinho told the club's official website. 'The players were, once more, brilliant. They could not have done better than what they did. (It was a) fantastic experience for the boys. 'There was a moment I was looking to the area and there was Axel at centre back to left, Demetri at left wing back, Garner in midfield on the left and Chong. 'At the same time it was Lewandowski on Axel, Robben on Mitchell, (Leon) Goretzka on Garner and (Niklas) Sule on Chong. 'It was fantastic, absolutely fantastic. We were playing against their best team, it was their complete squad apart from (Corentin) Tolisso.' Mourinho, who has been linked with moves for Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld and Leicester centre back Harry Maguire before Thursday's transfer window, selected Alexis Sanchez as captain in Bavaria. Reports in Germany on Sunday claimed United have also expressed an interest in Bayern defender Jerome Boateng. Forward Marcus Rashford donned the NO 10 shirt, with the club later confirming he would keep the squad number, previously worn by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney, for the coming season. 'Yeah, he wanted it. He always wanted it,' Mourinho said of Rashford's switch from 19 to 10. Of course, he respected the big Rooney and then Zlatan wanted to have it. 'He was in the shadow, waiting for the opportunity and now the shirt is empty. It's something fantastic for the kid, let's give the shirt to him.' Javi Martinez scored the only goal of the game, heading home from a second-half corner."
"Arturo Vidal has appeared in Barcelona colours for the first time after completing his £27million move from Bayern Munich. The midfielder, who joined the La Liga champions on Friday, took part in a photo shoot on Sunday as part of his official unveiling at the Nou Camp, where he could be seen posing in club colours.   He was all smiles as he clutched a Barcelona ball and stopped for pictures in front of the club crest in the Nou Camp megastore. Vidal will also fulfil a full programme of media duties on Monday as part of his presentation as a new Barcelona player. He is scheduled to sign a contract in the Presidential Suite around 11.30am before an unveiling in the main stand and pictures on the Nou Camp pitch in the afternoon. And speaking after the session, the 31-year-old signalled his intent to help his new team win trophies in the coming seasons. 'It is a dream,' he said. 'I hope to achieve my objectives. I am here to win all the trophies available and I will give everything on the pitch to achieve this.  'During the three-year contract, I hope we can win everything we play for. I am excited to play with Messi, Suarez, Sergio Busquets… they are all great players.' Vidal's arrival strengthens a Barcelona midfield that has lost Andres Iniesta and Paulinho this summer.  Fellow midfielder Arthur has also joined from Gremio, and the pair will compete for a place alongside stalwarts Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic."
"Anthony Martial and Marcos Rojo face an increasingly uncertain future at Manchester United after both players were left at home when Jose Mourinho's side travelled to Germany for their final pre-season game against Bayern Munich. Martial has fallen foul of manager Jose Mourinho after leaving United's pre-season tour of the US to be at the birth of his baby boy in Paris and going AWOL for a week. The Frenchman returned to training at Carrington on Friday but was not included in the squad that flew to Munich on Sunday morning. Mourinho wants to sell Martial and there has been talk of a swap deal for his old Chelsea winger Willian. But the Old Trafford hierarchy are keen to hold onto the 22-year-old former Monaco player, wary that he could embarrass the club by realising his potential at a rival club. Rojo has been identified as the odd man out among United's five centre-backs to make way for the new defender Mourinho wants before the transfer window closes on Thursday. Fred - Shakhtar Donetsk - £52million Diogo Dalot - Porto - £17.4million Lee Grant - Stoke - £1.5million  The Argentina defender returned to England after enjoying a post World Cup holiday, and has been in talks over his future. Everton are known to be interested in Rojo, who would cost in the region of £30million. Time is against United, however, and it is feasible that both players could remain at the club. Mourinho has been linked with a number of defensive targets including Harry Maguire, Toby Alderweireld, Yerry Mina and Jerome Boateng. A new centre-half remains the priority and Mourinho is banking on United chief Ed Woodward delivering one. Jerome Boateng — a half-time substitute for Bayern here — has emerged as a serious alternative to Harry Maguire who is being priced out of a move by Leicester. Talks are understood to have taken place between United and their German hosts on Sunday night over Boateng, who is valued at £45million even though he turns 30 next month. United would want to reduce that fee to nearer £40m. Asked about Boateng, Mourinho emphasised the need for United chief Woodward to make a new signing. 'The other clubs that compete with us are really strong or they have already fantastic squads like Chelsea, Spurs, City, or they are investing massively like for example Liverpool buying everything and everybody,' said Mourinho.  'If we don't make our team better it will be a difficult season for us. 'My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens."
"Unai Emery is considering a late swoop for Ricardo Rodriguez of AC Milan in a bid to solve Arsenal’s problems at left back. Sead Kolasinac faces up to 10 weeks out with a knee injury collected in last week’s friendly against Chelsea in Dublin. Nacho Monreal has not featured in pre-season having returned from the World Cup with a minor knee injury which has kept him out of full training. Monreal is expected to return to Emery’s squad this week but is a serious doubt for Sunday’s Premier League opener at home against Manchester City. Versatile youngster Ainsley Maitland-Niles is the most likely to step into the role against City. Rodriguez moved to Italy last summer after five years at Wolfsburg and made an instant impression. Milan are not keen to sell the 25-year-old Switzerland international and it may take £30million to prise him away. Meanwhile, new right back Stephan Lichtsteiner believes Arsenal are ready to ‘catch fire’ as the Emery era takes shape. The 34-year-old Swiss defender, signed on a free transfer from Juventus, played for the first time as Arsenal swept aside Lazio 2-0 in Stockholm on Saturday. After his World Cup exertions, Lichtsteiner, who won seven Serie A titles with Juventus, said: ‘We are ready and it was important to show this. I see players with big character and big qualities. I think this team just needs this last fire to explode. ‘It’s the same project like seven years ago at Juventus. It’s important to come back into the Champions League. Step by step we will grow and go forward. ‘When you are at big clubs like Arsenal it’s important to have in your head the aim to win titles.’"
"Calum Chambers is expected for a medical at Fulham on Monday after Arsenal agreed to let him move to Craven Cottage. The 23-year-old defender agreed a new four-year contract in July and is expected to sign on a season's loan. Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic is in desperate need of experienced defenders as Alfie Mawson is not expected to be fully fit until September. Chambers can cover a number of positions but Fulham still need another centre back.  They had made a bid to sign Yerry Mina on loan from Barcelona though he has spoken to other clubs including Everton and Manchester United.  The Premier League newcomers have signed six players so far in the summer transfer window, which closes on Thursday."
"Tottenham midfielder Mousa Dembele has rejected a £20million move to Inter Milan. The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract but has turned down the Serie A giants to remain in North London, despite falling down the pecking order under Mauricio Pochettino. Dembele, who was part of the Belgium squad at the World Cup in Russia, started 21 matches last season in the Premier League but saw Victor Wanyama picked ahead of him in the latter stages. The Italians have already signed Radja Nainggolan from Roma this summer and wanted to pair him with Belgian team-mate Dembele next season. Dembele is still one of the stand-out performers in the Premier League but he is understood to be looking to wind down his career as he struggles with the physical demands of the English season. Meanwhile, Tottenham have yet to receive a bid from Manchester United for Toby Alderweireld.  United may be forced to turn to either Jerome Boateng or Alderweireld in their pursuit of a new defender this summer after talks with Barcelona's Yerry Mina came to a halt."
"These four Surrey players made history last year when they all played against Middlesex.  It was the first time since the Second World War that a county had fielded a team in the County Championship containing four teenagers. Sam Curran, 20 Son of Zimbabwean Test player Kevin and younger brother of Tom, who played in last winter’s Ashes. Made his Test debut against Pakistan in June. Took five wickets and scored a fifty at Edgbaston last week. A genuine all-rounder who bowls fast-medium pace. Ollie Pope, 20 Rising star at Surrey. Despite only turning 20 this year he has already scored four first-class hundreds. Will become the 10th youngest England Test player on Thursday if he plays. Batsman who can keep as well. Ryan Patel, 20 Has been involved with Surrey since the age of eight. Opened for Surrey on his first-class debut last summer. Took a remarkable six for five against Somerset in the Championship last month. All-rounder who bowls medium pace. Amar Virdi, 20 Made his first-class debut last summer. Represented England Under 19s. Off-spinner. "
"When Jimmy Anderson stepped onto the golf course on Sunday, he would have been hoping for a very pleasant round in the sun with his friends.   Fresh off England's enthralling 31-run victory over India in the first Test at Edgbaston, Anderson decided to treat himself to a round of golf with Stuart Broad but his day out appeared to end in disaster. As Anderson struck an unpleasant shot from the woods, his golf ball appeared to hit a tree stump before smashing him powerfully in the face from close range. Scroll down for video...  But following the nasty incident, Anderson's England team-mate Broad saw the funny side of things.  The 32-year-old uploaded a video on Twitter of the incident, captioning the post: '@jimmy9 is perfectly fine', alongside nine laughing emojis. England will be hoping Anderson's injury doesn't affect him ahead of the second Test with India at Lord's, beginning on Thursday. Anderson bowled brilliantly during victory in Birmingham, taking four wickets during India's two innings. England have made two changes going into next week's Test in London, with Ollie Pope replacing Dawid Malan and Chris Woakes taking the place of Ben Stokes. "
"This is more like it. This is more like the bold, exciting and imaginative approach we were supposed to be getting when the apparently adventurous Joe Root replaced the seemingly conservative Alastair Cook as England Test captain. It did not work out that way last year when a selection panel that appeared to be following a different agenda to coach Trevor Bayliss - who kept on advocating Jos Buttler - picked uninspiring players like Gary Ballance and Liam Dawson. Now everything is different. New national selector Ed Smith, a surprising choice by Andrew Strauss ahead of the favourite Andy Flower, has been a revelation in picking 20-year-olds Dom Bess and Sam Curran and ‘white-ball specialists’ like Buttler and Adil Rashid. Now comes his boldest move yet. Ollie Pope, another 20-year-old, has made only 15 first-class appearances and has never appeared in the top five in Championship cricket but has been picked by Smith and company to replace No 4 Dawid Malan for the second Test. When the white smoke appeared over England’s Birmingham hotel yesterday Smith, his new sidekick James Taylor, Bayliss and Root had selected the latest exceptional young player to emerge from Surrey’s conveyor belt. And the mood appears to have rubbed off on Root who, frankly, has been a disappointment as captain so far but who led the team impressively at Edgbaston, especially on a last morning where he did everything right. Pope will now join his fellow Oval protege - Edgbaston man of the match Sam Curran - and there are more to come, like their team-mates Amar Virdi and Ryan Patel, from the academy of the Championship leaders who are setting the example for English cricket to follow. ‘Ollie has made an exceptional start to his first-class career and has been the division’s standout batsman this year,’ said Smith. ‘The panel believe Ollie’s performances and character suggest he is well suited to international cricket.’ He has certainly looked the part in making 684 runs in the Championship this season at an average of 85.50, which includes three centuries and a top score of 158 not out. He also impressed with an unbeaten half-century for the England Lions against India A before the first Test, which confirmed his place ahead of another exciting young batsman, Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke. What’s more, a young player who emerged first as a wicketkeeper before an outstanding last year at Cranleigh School two years ago has been picked as much on character as on his prodigious batting ability. ‘We would do a lot of sessions on the bowling machine with him wanting the speed up to at least 90 miles per hour, 10 or 15mph quicker than it would be for most good schoolboy players,’ Pope’s former director of cricket at Cranleigh, Stuart Welch, told Sportsmail. ‘He’s spent years developing his paddle scoops and ramp shots. Originally I thought he would be marked down for one-day cricket but he has come on rapidly in all forms of the game. ‘It’s interesting that he really hasn’t played much club or second-team cricket. In the past Surrey haven’t always been as keen to give chances to younger players so Alec Stewart deserves a lot of credit. I think last winter in Australia helped him too. ‘Ollie’s temperament is excellent. He’s deeply competitive but he’s also a decent and humble sort of lad who has time for other people. He played a full part in the school outside cricket.’ It was while Pope was in Australia playing grade cricket for Campbelltown last winter that he even came to the attention of the New South Wales parliament, with local MP and club stalwart Chris Patterson commending him in the Sydney house.  ‘Off the field he has been an absolute gentleman and a wonderful role model,’ said Patterson. Praise indeed from an Australian. Now the question will be where Pope fits into Smith’s brave new world. The absence of Ben Stokes through his appearance at Bristol Crown Court creates the usual question of balance with Chris Woakes, brought into the squad for Stokes, and Moeen Ali effectively competing with the Surrey youngster for two places. It is unlikely Pope would bat higher than six in Stokes’s place, which would mean perhaps Moeen at five or as high as four if England do not want to move Jonny Bairstow. And if Woakes misses out it would mean England having only three seamers, with Curran backing up Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson. Whatever combination England come up with, Bayliss knows they cannot allow their thrilling first Test victory to camouflage the problems that still haunt them. ‘It will be interesting to see who can step up and take Stokes’s place,’ said Bayliss after Saturday’s 31-run win. ‘Someone will have to put in the extra yards. We have things to work on, batting-wise and catching-wise. Hopefully we’ll have that confidence at Lord’s.’ England (v India at Lord’s): Root (capt), Ali, Anderson, Bairstow (wkt), Broad, Buttler, Cook, Curran, Jennings, Pope, Porter, Rashid, Woakes.   "
"England sealed a thrilling 31-run victory over India in the first Test on Saturday, with young Sam Curran shining at Edgbaston. Jimmy Anderson and Ben Stokes - who will miss the next Test in London at Lord's, starting on Thursday - also impressed for England in Birmingham. Here, Sportsmail columnist NASSER HUSSAIN has rated every player from the first Test... Alastair Cook - 3 Has a fabulous record against spin and against India but for such a good player he's being bowled off-stump too often by an off-spinner. Yes, his two dismissals came from excellent Ravichandran Ashwin deliveries but he's got to look at getting further across towards off stump. Catching 50-50 now too.   Keaton Jennings - 5.5 Looks organised against seamers and is a good player of spin but he has to think about his battle with Ashwin too. The changes he's made have made him more fluent and not as robotic and static at the crease. Unlucky to be bowled by Mohammed Shami first time but he has to convert one of these starts.   Joe Root - 8 Captaincy was exceptional throughout the second innings, the way he balanced attack and defence to protect a low target. There was a cry to open the bowling with Sam Curran after his second innings runs but he was sensible in backing his senior bowlers. Looked fluent at crease.   Dawid Malan - 3 Battled hard second innings but is getting trapped on the crease and coming further out does not come naturally to him. I would have given him one more chance at his home ground of Lord's but clearly the selectors felt the need for a change.   Jonny Bairstow - 7.5 Played well in the first innings but has to realise other batsmen are not as quick as him, particularly a captain with a bad back. Liked his counter-attacking style but maybe second innings he could have attacked Ashwin a bit more as a right-hander. It led to Virat Kohli taking him off when Sam Curran went after him.   Ben Stokes - 8 Attention will be on the final morning, when he was brilliant. But rhythm he had with his first spell in first innings from the pavilion end was as good as I've seen him bowl. Will be sorely missed at Lord's.   Jos Buttler - 4 For such a good player he gets out early to off-spin in the way Ashwin dismissed him in the first innings. Gets too far across to off-stump. Loose shot second time and just has to give himself a bit of time before he counter-attacks.   Sam Curran - 9.5 After his debut against Pakistan a lot of people, including me, were not sure he was even an international cricketer. But look at him now. Man of the match when the Indian captain got 200 runs in a low-scoring Test! Everything Curran did was match-changing. If it wasn't for him it would have been a three-day loss for England and everything would be doom and gloom. As it is, a 20-year-old has turned everything around and made us all positive.   Adil Rashid - 6 Very useful second innings runs batting with Curran. Root was spot on in his use of him in a low-scoring game where the ball was swinging and seaming around. His challenge will come when the ball is not moving around for the seamers and he will have to be a frontline bowler.   Stuart Broad - 6 Not at his best in first innings when he wasn't feeling well. But second innings was typical of him. When the pressure was on he put in an awesome spell to start that India collapse.   Jimmy Anderson - 8 Could have had so many more wickets. Bowled long spells too despite concerns about his shoulder. Should have had Kohli on 21 first time round and that could still be a key moment because if he'd gone then all the old questions would still need answers. India Murali Vijay 3, Shikhar Dhawan 3, KL Rahul 3, Virat Kohli 9.5, Ajinkya Rahane 3, Ravichandran Ashwin 9, Dinesh Karthik 4, Hardik Pandya 5, Ishant Sharma 8.5, Mohammed Shami 8, Umesh Yadav 5."
"Cristiano Ronaldo continued preparations for his first appearance in a Juventus shirt as he trained with a reduced squad in Turin on Sunday morning. The 33-year-old chose not to join Massimiliano Allegri and his senior squad during their pre-season tour of the USA. Instead, he has used the time to recover from his World Cup exploits and settle in Italy.  Despite not playing a single pre-season friendly yet, Ronaldo looked to be working his way towards fitness as he took part in a session at the club's Juventus Training Centre in Vinovo. Ronaldo's commitment will be a sight for Allegri's sore eyes after he watched his team lose 3-1 in their penultimate pre-season friendly against Ronaldo's old club Real Madrid at FedExField on Saturday night. That defeat, brought about by a Gareth Bale wonder-strike and a brace from Marco Asensio, was the last game on their US tour and the senior players will now head back to Italy to finally meet their new talisman. There is only one more pre-season amble before their Serie A campaign begins, the traditional 'family friendly' between Juventus and B team Juventus Primavera.  Scheduled to take place in the stunning Villar Sports Field on August 12, it could be Ronaldo's first run out in a black and white shirt. His presence would turn what is usually a quiet and understated affair into an event of international interest. Tickets were sold out long in advance of Ronaldo's arrival but they will now be worth significantly more than what the lucky few paid. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner will make his competitive debut on August 18 when Juventus kick off their Serie A title defence away to Chievo. Juve paid in excess of £100m to sign Ronaldo from Real Madrid in the expectation that he can help them continue their domestic dominance - and the hope he can finally deliver a long-awaited Champions League title. The Old Lady have not won UEFA's premiere competition since 1996 and have lost a notable five finals since then, including two in the last four seasons. Ronaldo, meanwhile, won it four times in five years with Real Madrid."
"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has poked fun at agent Mino Raiola, by playfully suggesting his mentor is literally squeezing money out of him. Ibrahimovic is one of Raiola's most famous clients, and the two have worked together throughout the years as the striker has completed one eye-wateringly huge transfer after another. The duo caught up in Los Angeles this week, with Raiola standing on Ibrahmimovic's back as part of a gym routine to stretch out the muscles. Making the most of the opportunity, Ibrahimovic uploaded the image to Instagram and made a dig at Raiola. 'When your agent tries to squeeze every last penny out of you,' wrote Ibrahimovic, in a caption accompanying the image. Raiola could be seen standing in the middle of the back of the Swedish icon as he lay on the floor, while keeping his balance by holding onto the wall.  The 36-year-old has been in impressive form since moving to the United States and turning out for LA Galaxy. Ibrahimovic has 15 goals in 17 games so far for his new side, after taking to the MLS with ease. Galaxy are still pushing for the top places in the table in the Western Conference, and currently sit in fifth place with 35 points. "
"Jose Mourinho is on a collision course with Manchester United chief Ed Woodward just five days before the start of the new Premier League season. Mourinho was on Saturday night no nearer to getting the two new signings he wants before the transfer window closes on Thursday - 24 hours before United's opening game at home to Leicester - and feels let down by Woodward's lack of support on the club's wretched tour of America. It has emerged that Mourinho's awkward encounter with Woodward in the tunnel after United's final game in Miami was their first meeting of any kind on the 17-day trip. United's executive vice-chairman also made a point of going into the dressing room at the Hard Rock Stadium to shake hands with all of the players, and did the same on the flight back to Manchester. 'It was as if Ed realised that he had to do more, but it was too little too late,' said a source last night. 'Everyone could see that Jose was completely mystified by Ed's absence. He's never experienced that before with a chairman on tour. Jose was miserable in the US but people began to see that he had a point.' The strained relationship between the two key figures at Old Trafford is the worst-possible preparation for the new season as United look to close the gap on champions Manchester City and keep up with their other rivals. Mourinho was upset that he had to lead such a high-profile tour with a threadbare squad and without the promise of new signings from Woodward, although he still hopes that will change before the transfer deadline. He desperately needs a new centre-back but United are facing defeat in their efforts to prise Harry Maguire from Leicester and have yet to make a formal offer for Barcelona's Yerry Mina. Mourinho also wants to sell Anthony Martial to make room for another forward but is at odds with Woodward, who would prefer to keep the French winger. United play their final pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Sunday evening."
"The result was eye-catching, the performance at times sizzling. Jurgen Klopp knew how it would all be perceived so he felt the moment was right to apply the brakes. Liverpool had thrashed Napoli 5-0. It was their sixth win in eight pre-season friendlies, during which time they have scored 24 goals. The new signings have bedded in swiftly and their preparations have been smooth compared to the well-documented issues of some rivals. It would appear, then, that things are only pointing in one direction — Liverpool look primed to launch a proper challenge for the Premier League as the side best equipped to make Manchester City think. Klopp, however, was forthright in how he saw it all. ‘First of all, I really hope our fans are understanding,’ he said. ‘We have shown a lot of good things in the last few years but it was never in one second easy and it will not be easy this season. If we win a game, we win a game. We must win the next as well, not celebrate anything as if it is decided. ‘We have high expectations of ourselves but our situation has not changed. Why should it?’ Good luck with trying to keep expectations in check. Liverpool have strengthened every area they needed to and players such as Naby Keita and goalkeeper Alisson, who made his debut in Dublin, are only going to improve. If Liverpool aren’t going to be genuine contenders this season, after spending so heavily and securing the futures of key figures such as Mohamed Salah - scorer of the third goal against Napoli - and Roberto Firmino, when are they going to challenge? Klopp, at least, did recognise Liverpool’s foundations are strong, illustrated by the fact a player of Xherdan Shaqiri’s quality can come off the bench and fit into the team seamlessly. But he doesn’t believe the teams who surround them have too many deficiencies. ‘I do not see that United has got weaker, or City weaker,’ said Klopp. ‘Tottenham have not sold a player and have stayed together. I think Arsenal and Chelsea will be stronger than last year. Everton obviously are pushing from behind. Wolves are not shy to spend money. The league will be difficult. ‘It is not about judging our situation and thinking: “Really good!”. We need to be ready each week, not only for a few games. That is our challenge. ‘When I speak about not having crazy expectations, if we keep the atmosphere within the club from last year we have a chance of a really big season. I’m really happy with the new players.’  "
"Rafa Benitez has revealed that his Newcastle players are just as frustrated as him with Mike Ashley's apparent refusal to invest in new signings. The boss is mystified as to the owner's reluctance to back him in the transfer market and has warned that another season fighting relegation lies in store. They are refusing to speak to the press while the bonus dispute continues and we understand they are also considering not fulfilling obligations with some media rights holders, which could lead to financial penalties for the club. Asked if his team shared his concerns, Benitez said: 'One hundred per cent. The players know. They want to have better players around because they have more possibilities to win.'  The Spaniard wants four more signings before this week's deadline and West Brom striker Salomon Rondon is set to arrive in a loan swap deal with Dwight Gayle going the other way. But Benitez - who is yet to sign a new contract - had hoped it would be very different, especially as Newcastle are £26million in profit this summer. 'My idea was that at this stage of pre-season everything would be completed and we would be ready and working with my players for one month - it's not the case,' he said. 'If they trust us, give us the tools, we will deliver. We have done it everywhere and won trophies. In this case, I was expecting we could deliver something.'  He added: 'To balance the team we need four players. Can we do it? Yes. Can we do the ideal window now? It's impossible because we have lost the opportunities. It's a pity that after two months we are talking about the last five days. 'It will be more difficult than last year. Wolves, Fulham, Cardiff, especially the first two, are spending money. Crystal Palace, West Ham, everyone is spending money. 'I've had the meeting (with Ashley) and I talk with Lee Charnley (managing director) every day. They know my idea, I know their ideas. 'I can talk (about a new contract), but we have to walk the walk and talk the talk. We have to do things. It has to be done. If we want to improve, you need to be sure it will be done. 'The problem is we have been talking about the future for the past month and we are not going in the same direction. 'I will fight until the end. I cannot guarantee anything. But in my head, it's to stay and to fight and make sure we do well. If everything is right then we can talk about the future.'"
"Wolves are likely to complete a £20million deal for Adama Traore over the next 48 hours.   The pacey winger is set to undergo a medical on Monday ahead of his club-record move from Middlesbrough. Wolves are believed to be paying an initial £10m up front and then the rest of the fee will come in installments. Those could take the total fee to over £20m, depending on the number of appearances he makes among other things. Last season Traore, who joined from Aston Villa in 2016, scored five goals and provided ten assists for Middlesbrough across 36 Championship appearances. It means Nuno Espirito Santo has added another new face to his Wolves squad after already completing deals for Raul Jimenez, Joao Moutinho and Ruo Patricio among others. Wolves begin their long-awaited return to the Premier League at home to Everton on Saturday."
"Justin Thomas didn't have to show much of his 'nasty streak' to get the job done and win the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday. Not with Rory McIlroy showing his meek side and Ian Poulter undoing much of the good work of his first three days with a miserable final round. McIlroy had talked in the build-up of admiring Thomas's ruthlessness under the gun, but this was more about another of those final days this year and a head-to-head when the Northern Irishman simply hasn't delivered.  It began at the Dubai Desert Classic in February, continued at the Masters, and represents a rather large black cloud hanging over a season with an otherwise sunny aspect.  The 29-year-old, who began in joint second place alongside Poulter, and three behind Thomas, went from first in driving on Saturday to almost dead last on Sunday, and when that club doesn't work around Firestone, you've got no chance of applying pressure.  Needless to say, this was hardly the result McIlroy was looking for as he tries to end a four year drought in the majors this week at the US PGA Championship. By contrast, this was the perfect result for Thomas  ahead of his title defence. He shot 69 for an easy four-stroke victory over fellow American Kyle Stanley, with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen and Dustin Johnson tied third. McIlroy finished tied sixth after a 73. Poulter began needing a top-five finish to move above Paul Casey into the last automatic slot for Europe's Ryder Cup team, but a bogey at the first set the tone for a poor 74 for tied 10th spot. He will get a Ryder Cup wild card, regardless, and deservedly so, but this will sting, nonetheless. In the Ryder Cup stakes, therefore, the big winner proved Olesen, who came from nowhere with his excellent 64. He began the week as one of those players on the bubble but he's a feisty character with a fabulous putting stroke, and there's every chance now that Denmark will not only provide Europe with its captain in Thomas Bjorn but a member of the team as well.  Much earlier, the sweat had poured off Tiger Woods on to an error-strewn card showing a back nine featuring just one par. 'He doesn't seem to be moving well at all,' said Sir Nick Faldo on American television, prompting speculation as to whether the 42-year-old was hurt once more. 'It was just one of those weeks,' said Woods after signing off with a second mediocre 73 to finish outside the top 30. I've certainly got work to do to get ready for the US PGA but I'm confident I'll be good to go come Thursday."
"There's been sadness behind the joy for Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the past 10 months. The collection of two gold medals tell a story of potential finally being fulfilled, but there has also been a painful loss. Her father, Ricky Thompson, passed away on his home island of the Bahamas last November, aged just 59, and despite living apart from his daughter in Liverpool since she was one, they had a good relationship. 'It's been difficult, especially winter,' Johnson-Thompson told Sportsmail. Aside from a short Instagram post the day after his funeral in which Johnson-Thompson detailed his 'infectious laugh and a heart of pure love', it's not a subject she's discussed publicly since, and yet it is also one of the driving forces behind her attempt to pull off one of the toughest challenges in athletics next week: beating Nafissatou Thiam across the seven disciplines of a heptathlon. If the 25-year-old succeeds against long odds by winning the European Championships in Berlin, it would complete an extraordinary hat-trick in 2018 for a talented athlete who had often underperformed on the bigger occasions before breaking through this season with gold medals at the world indoors and Commonwealth Games. That is a monumentally big 'if', of course. Those wins, grand as they are, were secured against weaker fields, while Belgium's Thiam is the reigning world and Olympic champion and the third best heptathlete of all time, with a top score of 7,013 points - achieved on the same weekend in Austria in May 2017 when Johnson-Thompson set her own personal best some 322 points astern. It's a big gap that feels bigger still when you consider Johnson-Thompson's revelation that her preparations for Germany have been significantly affected by the calf injury she picked up while winning at the Commonwealth Games. But bridging that gulf is where her father comes in again, for while it would be misleading to suggest her two gold medals were inspired solely by his memory - she would have beaten the opposition anyway - Johnson-Thompson is clear about the extra motivation she has drawn for Berlin from Ricky's death. 'What happened with my dad is why I have been so switched on in competitions,' she said. 'He didn't see me win and that has actually made me want to win in front of my mum (Tracey) even more, if that makes sense. 'She comes to see me in every single competition and I always feel for her when I don't do well, or I let myself down, or I don't reach my potential. 'I really want to involve her and I really want her to experience me winning and doing it. That is why I was so happy in Birmingham for the world indoors and the Commonwealth Games.  'When you miss chances, you feel like you miss giving opportunities for your family to see you do well. Your family are proud of you anyway, obviously, but this is just something inside me that pushes me on a bit extra.'  Missing chances has been something of a theme in Johnson-Thompson's career before this year. Great expectations have hovered over her since she became world junior champion in 2009 but it has been slow going - she blew it with three long jump fouls when sitting second at the 2015 worlds, faded to sixth at the Rio Olympics and wrecked her 2017 worlds in London with a poor high jump.  The throws have typically been her weakness, but the head had been equally suspect in big moments, and that is why there is such excitement within the sport over what she might now achieve with the confidence of two gold medals to her name. For that end, Johnson-Thompson sees the next three to four years as crucial, with a growing sense that time is hurrying along in her career. 'You do feel the years go by,' she said. 'Major opportunities come once year and you put it all on the line and if it doesn't go well then you wait an entire year for the next chance at a major medal. Like I say, you do feel the years going by when it's like that. 'I feel I am coming towards my peak opportunities in the next three or four years. I used to think Tokyo 2020 would be my main one but maybe it will be 2024. Maybe then I will go for a single event but I am going year by year.  'The next few years are important but I do believe I haven't my potential yet.' The strength of Thiam, who is two years younger at 23, has complicated the landscape, of course. 'She has achieved everything I want to achieve,' Johnson-Thompson said. 'People are not bigging her up too much at all - I hope people big her up because if I had done what she has done I would want people to talk about me in that way. 'I used to think if I was top of my game in every event then no one could beat me but Thiam has better PBs added up than me. I have had to reassess my life a little bit after the 7,000 points she got last year but I do believe I am still able to get PBs. 'I'm looking forward to going against her. She's a great athlete and a really nice person but I know from experience that anything can happen in a heptathlon.'  From her training base in southern France, the confidence for Berlin has only been spoken in muted terms. The calf injury put her behind 'where I wanted to be at the start of the year', but then again she can satisfied with two gold medals by April and a shot at a third in August. 'I'm always going for more,' she said. 'I have not arrived yet so I need to push on.' It will take some shove to dislodge Thiam. Live TV coverage begins on Monday on BBC and British Eurosport."
"Georgia Hall was joyously embraced by her caddie after becoming the first homegrown player to win the Ricoh Women’s British Open in nine years on Sunday. And to make the moment all the sweeter, the caddie in question was none other than her dad, Wayne. The golf-mad plasterer named his daughter Georgia when she was born halfway through Nick Faldo and Greg Norman’s epic duel at the Masters at Augusta, Georgia, in 1996.  But even Wayne could hardly have believed that 22 years later Georgia, who had never previously tasted victory on the Ladies European Tour or LPGA Tour, would be winning a major of her own after a superb five-under final round of 67 at Royal Lytham. To cap it, she pocketed the winner’s cheque worth almost £375,000. Trailing Pornanong Phatlum by a shot overnight, Hall, from Bournemouth, moved clear of the Thai with two holes remaining, and held her nerve to secure victory. Her bogey on the last hole was her first of the round, and she dropped just three shots in the whole tournament. Hall fought back tears at the presentation ceremony as she dedicated the victory to her grandfather, saying: ‘There’s someone very special at home that’s going through a bad time so this is for you grandad. ‘I’d also like to thank my dad for caddying. Thanks for doing everything for me when I was growing up… and to my mum. And to my boyfriend as well for supporting me.’ In fact boyfriend Harry Tyrrell is normally the one on the bag only for him to be ‘jocked off’ by dad Wayne for this week. ‘Dad’s caddied for me in this for the last four or five years - it is kind of our thing,’ Hall, the world No 39, said earlier in the week. ‘And we played so well together last year that it’s right for him to be on the bag.’ Hall’s victory on Sunday meant the 2013 British women’s amateur champion emulated compatriot Karen Stupples (2004) and Scot Catriona Matthew (2009), the other two British winners since this event became a major. She said: ‘I don’t think it’s all sunk in for me. It was my goal when I was nine years old on the putting green, “This six-footer’s for the British Open” - and to actually have that, I’m over the moon. I’m so happy.’ (GB & Ire unless stated, par 72): 271: Georgia Hall 67 68 69 67. 273: Pornanong Phatlum (Tha) 67 67 69 70. 275: So Yeon Ryu (Kor) 69 69 67 70. 279: Ariya Jutanugarn (Tha) 71 70 69 69, Mamiko Higa (Jpn) 66 69 71 73, Sei Young Kim (Kor) — 71 71 71 66. 280: Carlota Ciganda (Spa) 69 73 68 70, Yu Liu (Chn) 69 72 68 71, Shanshan Feng (Chn) 71 71 69 69. 281: Minjee Lee (Aus) 65 70 71 75."
"Dylan Hartley is facing a race to be fit for the start of the season as the England skipper continues his recovery from concussion. Hartley, who captained England to 21 victories in Eddie Jones’s first 22 games in charge, has been out of action since suffering a head injury during England’s Six Nations defeat by Ireland at Twickenham on March 17. The Northampton hooker sat out England’s summer tour of South Africa on medical advice, but returned to the England camp for last weekend’s training camp in Teddington. Asked if Hartley would return for the start of the new season, England forwards coach Steve Borthwick said: ‘I think that’s ongoing as he progresses through the process. The start of the season is a month away so he’s progressing. Everything’s going well at this stage.’ Head coach Jones, Borthwick and scrum coach Neal Hatley will travel to Japan on Tuesday for a 12-day coaching trip ahead of next year’s World Cup. Meanwhile, ex-All Black coach John Mitchell’s promotion to replace Paul Gustard as England defence coach gathered pace on Sunday with reports in South Africa stating that his current club, the Blue Bulls, are already ‘shopping around’ for a new head coach."
"Adam Peaty's new 100-metres breaststroke world record has been adjusted due to a problem with the timing mechanism, the European Swimming Federation (LEN) has announced. The Uttoxeter 23-year-old recorded a time of exactly 57 seconds in his final at the European Championships in Glasgow on Saturday night. But it will now go into the record books as 57.10 after officials revealed a 'configuration delay' of 0.10 seconds affecting the first nine races of the session. The revised time has no effect on his achievement in the Tollcross pool, given the new mark still eclipses his previous best of 57.13secs set in the Olympic final in Rio in 2016. LEN said in a statement: 'During the afternoon competition session on Saturday 4 August 2018, the LEN Technical Swimming Committee became aware of a potential problem in relation to the race timing equipment for the first nine races of that session. 'Upon thorough investigation it became apparent that the starting mechanism had been incorrectly configured prior to the start of the session which resulted in all reported times being 0.10s faster due to a configuration delay of 0.10s. 'The LEN TSC working with the timing system operators carried out extensive tests to confirm this system configuration error and have, with the benefit of the necessary technical analysis, revised all recorded times for the first nine races during that session. 'The LEN TSC confirms that all times recorded during the first three competition sessions and after the first nine races of that session (subsequently) are accurate.' The second world record set in the session, in which Russia's Kliment Kolesnikov eclipsed Liam Tancock's previous best 50m backstroke time by 0.04secs, is therefore unaffected by the changes. Peaty is due to launch his bid for a second European gold medal in the 50m breaststroke heats which begin on Tuesday evening. Chris Spice, British Swimming's national performance director, said in a statement: 'We support LEN's vigilance in this matter and appreciate the time they have taken to make sure all times are correct. 'We want this event to be remembered for the amazing achievements of the athletes so it is important that the results are correct. 'We don't want this to take away from Adam's amazing performance which we all experienced in a fantastic arena.'"
"A night that was supposed to be all about the goalkeeper became a night that was all about the goals. Liverpool handed Alisson Becker his first start following his £65million arrival from Roma in their eighth pre-season friendly but for all that the Brazilian cut an imposing and assured figure, you could not have left the Aviva Stadium without being taken aback by Jurgen Klopp’s attack. It would be wrong to say this was a first whistle to last story of relentless, creative football – they were fatigued after a week’s intensive training in the French Alps – but during the spells in which it all clicked for Liverpool, they had far too many guns for Napoli.   They scored five, two of which came in the opening nine minutes, and with greater composure, that final score could have been doubled in front of a sell-out 51,512 crowd in Dublin; if a tally of 24 goals in pre-season is a gauge, watching Liverpool when the real business starts will not be dull. This was the first time Klopp selected Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane since the Champions League final on May 26; Firmino only returned to training on Monday but here was a clear pointer they will be unleashed when West Ham arrive at Anfield next Sunday. You could go a step further and say the 11 that started here will be the ones to whom Klopp turns when the real business begins – Liverpool have one more friendly against Torino at Anfield on Tuesday – and he will be content with the shape they are in. A sense of what type of game this was going to be arrived in the fourth minute.  Becker’s first meaningful touch was a 60-yard pass that flew like a javelin into the feet of Salah to launch an attack and 20 seconds after the Egyptian had controlled it, James Milner had opened the scoring with a thumping left-footed drive. Milner – who later suffered a gruesome head wound – was heavily involved in the second, too. His pinpoint cross dipped into the Napoli six-yard area and as their defence dithered, Gini Wijnaldum nipped in front of goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis to double the advantage. ‘James Milner played a brilliant game and then went off with a crazy cut,’ said Klopp. ‘He's had 15 stitches in his face. He's quite positive about it but nobody has shown him a mirror so far.’ Napoli had some promising moments, the best of which was when Lorenzo Insigne forced Becker into a scrambling save in the 26th minute, but they were never enough to trouble Liverpool, who ran amok in the second half. Klopp took Firmino off and replaced him with Xherdan Shaqiri and the Swiss forward enhanced Liverpool’s attacking, his passing continually put Napoli’s defence on the turn. His deep cross in the 58th minute led to Salah thrashing a left-footed drive into the top corner. Napoli, who are a week behind Liverpool in terms of preparations, began to wilt and soon Klopp’s men had a fourth when Daniel Sturridge drove in from 12 yards after Divock Origi’s shot had been saved; he was making it third time lucky after twice going close in the 69th and 70th minutes.  Still Liverpool were not content and Alberto Moreno completed the rout in the 80th minute, slamming in a drive at the back post. Another positive 90 minutes, then, which also featured another eye-catching cameo from Academy graduate Curtis Jones. ‘The result isn't something I'm interested in,’ said Klopp. ‘There were a lot of really good moments, especially around the goals. Organisation wise is was good in parts and average in others. There were too many times for Napoli at times and it's something we will work on. ‘You could see that some players were tired. Endurance wise, they aren't where they need to be so we need to work on that. I don't care what people think how about our team and our squad, it's not important, it's only important we make sure we get a team together for Torino on Tuesday. ‘West Ham will be a completely different challenge. Don't let the expectations grow. The Premier League is hard work, it's not about winning 5-0. But of course winning 5-0 is much better than losing and having no confidence. We know what we have to work on.’ Things, of course, will be tougher when the Premier League begins but for all that he wanted to sound a note of caution, Klopp cannot escape the fact that Liverpool’s preparations have been almost perfect. You get the sense their form will have been noted in Manchester and London too. "
"Leicester have agreed a deal to sign winger Rachid Ghezzal from Monaco, the Premier League club have announced. The Foxes will pay an undisclosed fee for the 26-year-old Algeria international, who has put pen to paper on a four-year contract. Ghezzal becomes the fifth new arrival this summer at the King Power Stadium after Jonny Evans, James Maddison, Ricardo Pereira and Danny Ward. Leicester boss Claude Puel said: 'I'm very pleased to welcome Rachid to Leicester City Football Club. He's an exciting addition to our group who will bring creativity and competition ahead of an important season for us. 'I know his qualities from my time at Lyon, where he was in the academy, and I look forward to seeing him test himself in the Premier League.' During his time at Lyon, Ghezzal scored 14 goals and provided 20 assists in his 110 appearances. His form attracted the interest of then-French champions Monaco and he moved there in August 2017.  The winger is looking forward to working under Puel again. He told LCFC TV: 'I'm very excited and very happy to be here. I know the coach from Lyon and this is where I want to be. It's a good club and an ambitious one too.' Ghezzal will link up with his new team-mates this week ahead of Leicester's opening game of the new Premier League season at Manchester United on Friday night.  "
"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that he is aiming to bring in a new defensive midfielder before the transfer window closes on Thursday evening. Guardiola wants to sign a player who can be an alternative option to Fernandinho at the base of City's midfield, but time is running out to get a deal done. City have been linked with several midfielders, including  Miralem Pjanic of Juventus, Marco Verratti of Paris Saint-Germain and Mateo Kovacic of Real Madrid. As reported by Goal, when pressed on whether City will make any further signings, Guardiola said: 'I don't know. We are trying. 'We would like to find maybe one more because we don't have two specific players to substitute Fernandinho. 'But if he doesn't come, there will not be anyone else. I don't know [if we are close]. I was focused on the final, so we will just see.' August 12 - Arsenal (away) August 19 - Huddersfield (home) August 25 - Wolves (away) September 1 - Newcastle (home) September 15 - Fulham (home)    City have made just one major acquisition so far this summer, with Riyad Mahrez joining from Leicester, but nonetheless Guardiola's side look in excellent shape as they aim to retain the Premier League title. Sergio Aguero hit a brace on Sunday as City beat Chelsea 2-0 in the Community Shield and the champions will be full of confidence next weekend when they face Arsenal away in the Premier League. Last season City enjoyed much success as they won the Premier League title in spectacular fashion and also lifted the League Cup.  This season they will be determined to go all the way in the Champions League having been knocked out by Liverpool at the quarter-final stage last campaign. "
"Salomon Rondon held talks with Newcastle United on Sunday night ahead of his £2million loan move which will see Dwight Gayle head to West Brom. 27-year-old striker Gayle also held talks on Sunday night with Baggies head coach Darren Moore. Rondon scored ten goals in 39 games for West Brom across all competitions last season but was unable to prevent the club from suffering relegation. Meanwhile, Gayle found the net six times in 37 appearances for Newcastle last campaign as they finished 10th in the Premier League. Newcastle boss Benitez is desperate to add to his squad before the transfer window slams shut on Thursday and he has revealed that his players are just as frustrated as him with Mike Ashley's apparent refusal to invest in new signings. The boss is mystified as to the owner's reluctance to back him in the transfer market and has warned that another season fighting relegation lies in store. Asked if his team shared his concerns, Benitez said: 'One hundred per cent. The players know.  'They want to have better players around because they have more possibilities to win.'  "
"Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui is confident Luka Modric will remain at the Bernabeu despite interest from clubs in Italy. The European champions defeated Juventus 3-1 in the International Champions Cup on Saturday night but Modric played no part in the contest. Reports in Italy have suggested Inter Milan have prepared a bumper salary of £10million for the Croatian playmaker, but Lopetegui says he is going nowhere. The manager echoed the words of club president Florentino Perez, who said only an outlandish bid of £660m would persuade Real to sell Modric. 'The president has already given an answer, I don't have much else to add,' Lopetegui said. 'Modric's an extraordinary player, we await him with open arms. I talked to him after his excellent World Cup and we'll see if he can play on August 15 (against Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup), our first big objective of the season. 'I told him he was a player I'm passionate about, I love him and he knows it. He'll be happy with the proposal he receives here. 'He'll be happy to play football, like he already was, at Real Madrid. Luka is a Madrid player and will continue to be, I have no doubt. We've enjoyed having him and we'll continue to do so.' His comments came as Spanish newspaper AS claimed Modric has demanded a meeting with Real over his future upon returning from his extended holiday following Croatia's run to the World Cup final.  "
"West Ham face a late challenge from Burnley for defensive target Harold Moukoudi. Talks are ongoing with Le Havre over a £10.7m fee for the centre-back but the French want a sell-on clause included in any deal. Manuel Pellegrini has already strengthened in the heart of his defence so far this summer with the arrivals of Issa Diop and Fabian Balbuena. Burnley have signed Ben Gibson but want more cover as they wait on Ben Mee agreeing a new contract.  Joe Hart will have his medical on Monday to ease fears over their goalkeeper issues with both Tom Heaton and Nick Pope injured. Burnley have bolstered their squad with English talent as their Europa League campaign continues. They face Turkish side Istanbul BB next Thursday having overcome Aberdeen in the previous qualifying round. It could give Gibson a chance of returning to the England set-up. He was called up three times by Gareth Southgate while a Premier League player with Boro, but has yet to make a senior appearance."
"Chelsea are ready to make a decision on whether or not to step up their interest in Wilfried Zaha this summer as part of a transfer meeting at Stamford Bridge. Maurizio Sarri is due to sit down with Chelsea chiefs to discuss potential signings ahead of this week's transfer deadline and the Crystal Palace star will be top of the agenda. The 25-year-old would be open to a move to a top-six club and has told team-mates there is an offer for him to leave Selhurst Park. However, no one has come close to meeting Palace's £70million evaluation. That is unlikely to change whether or not Chelsea make a move to sign him before Thursday's deadline as they have so far been unwilling to offer more than £30m plus players on loan. The Eagles are under little pressure to sell after tying Zaha to a long-term deal in 2017 worth £100,000 per week, but the Ivory Coast international made his intentions clear by rejecting improved terms earlier this summer.  That deal would have increased his wage to £125,000 per week, but Zaha is well aware that he could earn significantly more at Stamford Bridge. Whether Chelsea move nearer to their valuation will depend on the future of Willian, who came close to joining Barcelona this summer and has also been linked with a move to Manchester United.  They would be willing to sell the Brazil international for £75m but Sarri wants a replacement lined up before signing off on the deal.  Chelsea's transfer activity has been limited this summer with Jorginho and back-up goalkeeper Robert Green the only arrivals.  Sarri, whose own arrival was delayed due to a disagreement between the club and Antonio Conte, still wants a bigger squad ahead of his first season in charge. Despite reports to the contrary, Tottenham have not registered an interest in Zaha so far this summer, with Mauricio Pochettino instead focusing his efforts and limited resources on Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish. That gives Chelsea a clear run at the player, although significant hurdles remain if they are to agree a deal before the transfer window closes."
"Jose Mourinho and Ed Woodward have been urged to put their heads together and bring the good times back to Manchester United, by the club's former chief executive Peter Kenyon. Kenyon was a key figure at United during the glory years of Sir Alex Ferguson and has watched from a distance as the Red Devils have struggled to land the Premier League title for the past five years. Their hopes of ending that sequence this term have not been helped by a pre-season dominated by Mourinho's gloomy demeanour and clear frustration over transfers, an issue which places his relationship with executive vice-chairman Woodward in the spotlight. Kenyon acknowledges things have yet to click two years into the Portuguese's reign but does believe it can happen. 'They have to work it out and they'll find a way of working it out,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek. 'United is bigger than anybody, bigger than any individual and that's always been the mantra.  'It will get worked out and I would hope Jose is part of that working it out because he is incredibly skilled and he's demonstrated he can do things. 'He is more than capable, one of the best coaches in the world but have they got it right? No. 'I think the first people to recognise that will be the people at United. FRIENDLY Sunday - Bayern Munich (A) PREMIER LEAGUE Friday - Leicester City (H) August 19 - Brighton (A) August 27 - Tottenham (H) September 1 - Burnley (A) September 15 - Watford (A)  'Jose has all the capabilities, he's done it, but I don't think he's in a place where he feels good at the moment, or United feel good at the moment or the fans at the moment.' Kenyon sees Manchester City's rise as particularly difficult for United to deal with but is sure his old side have everything they need to close the gap on last year's runaway champions. 'They've got more competition than they've ever had before and it's coming from the other side of the city,' he said. 'Having been born there and lived there, that's pretty uncomfortable. They're just going to have to dig in and sort it out. 'They have the resources, they've got a fantastic fan-base and one of the best coaches in the world. They've just to work out what it is and sort it.'  "
"The main attraction at the Hawthorns on Saturday wasn't the return of competitive football but instead West Brom's crazy new mascot.   We have seen plenty of bizarre mascots down the years within football but perhaps none as weird as West Brom's 'Boiler Man' that was introduced to the crowd on the weekend. Ahead of the Baggies' opening Championship clash with Bolton, the new mascot was unveiled following the club's sponsorship deal with Hull-based company Ideal Boilers. West Brom announced a two-year sponsorship with Ideal Boilers back in May and the players now don the company's logo on both their playing and training tops. Inevitably, following its unveiling, fans couldn't believe their own eyes and took to social media to share their hilarious pictures of the mascot. One fan wrote on Twitter: 'WBA's mascot's a boiler! I thought someone was having me on', alongside two crying laughter emojis.  Meanwhile another supporter amusingly admitted 'I had to take a photo just to confirm that's what I saw'. However, unfortunately for the West Brom fans, the new mascot couldn't inspire their team to victory and they instead fell to a late 2-1 defeat to Bolton. Josh Magennis gave the visitors the lead in the 18th minute before Harvey Barnes equalised for Darren Moore's on the stroke of half-time. It looked as if both sides would share the spoils but Bolton won the game right at the death thanks to an 89th minute winner from Yanic Wildschut. "
"Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard has returned to pre-season training after his extended break following England's World Cup campaign. The 25-year-old posted a video on to his Instagram story on Sunday afternoon following his workout at Carrington. Walking across the pitches at United's training base, Lingard said: 'Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy work. 'Paulo (United coach) didn't want to run did he today? Me on my own running again.' The rest of the United squad played their final pre-season friendly in Germany against Bayern Munich on Sunday night.  Lingard also uploaded two pictures on to the social media platform on Sunday evening at Fontainebleau Miami Beach after returning to work. The caption read: 'Miami, we out. Until next time.'  Lingard had been working on his fitness with team-mate Marcus Rashford after meeting up in Miami last weekend.    Lingard and Rashford were part of the England team that made it to the semi-finals of the tournament in Russia before Gareth Southgate's side were beaten by Croatia. United kick-off the Premier League season when they welcome Leicester to Old Trafford on Friday night.   "
"Tony Pulis has seen pre-season come and go, watched his side pull off a dramatic late comeback in their opening game and still he does not believe Middlesbrough are ready for the campaign ahead. They have been hotly tipped for promotion, coming in as second favourites prior to the first ball being kicked, but Middlesbrough’s own manager is clear that work still needs to be done to the squad. They went into Saturday’s game against Millwall without defensive lynchpin and captain Ben Gibson, who is about to complete a £15million move to Burnley. Patrick Bamford was sold to Leeds, while last season’s loanee Muhamed Besic returned to Everton. Adama Traore - targeted by Wolves - and Daniel Ayala are both out injured. As Pulis himself put it: ‘They’re all top players.’ A squad that included that cast of players fell at the semi-final stage in last season’s play-offs, nevermind doing what the bookies, and many pundits, expect of those left behind and winning automatic promotion. There are targets to improve the squad. Martyn Waghorn, the Ipswich striker, is a target for a move to The Riverside. They would have to pay around £5million for a player the East Anglian club signed for just £250,000 last summer. Luke Freeman at Queens Park Rangers is another player Pulis wants, although his club have been adamant that he will not be leaving Loftus Road this summer. ‘We know we have to bring players in,’ Pulis continued, before admitting: ‘That group is not good enough to get us promoted. It’s a smashing group but it’s not good enough to get us promoted.’ He may not have the players yet, but the 61-year-old definitely has the spirit in his camp. They recovered from a two-goal deficit in the 87th minute to draw on Saturday - George Friend equalising with the last kick of the game. Lee Gregory, who set up Millwall’s first and scored the second after an error from Boro new boy Aden Flint, tried to take the positives from the late blow: ‘We are absolutely gutted, that goes without saying. ‘But I think once it’s settled in in the next couple of days, we’ve competed with a side that has competed with a top six minimum. And I think we have held our own’. Gregory clearly rates Saturday’s opponents highly, and thinks that bodes well for the Lions: ‘On paper we should not be drawing with Middlesbrough. So we have done well. Everyone knocks us down and we just prove each tie we should be up here.’ "
"Ben Gibson has returned to Premier League football after completing his £15million switch from Middlesbrough to Burnley. Gibson, the nephew of Boro chairman Steve, joined the club's academy aged 12 and went on to make 203 appearances and captain his hometown club. He was a near ever present in each of the last three seasons, playing a key role in the 2015-16 promotion campaign. Gibson also played every minute in Boro's subsequent Premier League campaign, and played 50 times last season as the Teesiders reached the Championship play-offs.  The 25-year-old also spent time on loan at Plymouth, Tranmere and York, but now will get the opportunity to play European football at Turf Moor. Burnley have bolstered their squad with English talent as their Europa League campaign continues. They face Turkish side Istanbul BB next Thursday having overcome Aberdeen in the previous qualifying round.  It could give Gibson a chance of returning to the England set-up. He was called up three times by Gareth Southgate while a Premier League player with Boro, but has yet to make a senior appearance. "
"It needed something pretty special to upstage Graham Potter on his winning start as Swansea boss. Yan Dhanda provided exactly that, presenting his new manager with the winning goal - with his very first touch four minutes from time. Now Dhanda himself needs something special to top this extraordinary start to his Swansea career after moving from Liverpool. And the 19-year-old attacking midfielder looks no further than the inspirational example of his friend and former Anfield club mate Trent Alexander-Arnold, who went to the World Cup with England. ‘We’re quite close and I hope I can follow him, do what he’s doing,’ said Dhanda who sprang off the bench to apply the fine finish that crowned Swansea’s comeback for a deserved victory at Bramall Lane. ‘To play for England is my dream, to go to the World Cup, to play in the Champions League.’ And with a self-deprecating grin: ‘I’m only young, but I want it all.’ The goal? ‘I was imagining it all day, coming on and scoring. When the chance came, it was like it had happened before - but it seems like a dream now.’ Potter, appointed after stunning work with one-time Swedish minnows Ostersund, found the Midas touch with his substitutions after seeing his side trail - with no complaints at that stage - to an excellent George Baldock strike. Saturday  - Preston (home) August 17 - Birmingham (away) August 21 - Leeds (home) August 25 - Bristol City (home) September 1 - Millwall (away)  First sub Jefferson Montero tormented United’s right flank to set up Dhanda’s goal in the wake of Oli McBurnie’s equaliser. ‘Montero’s a Premier League player really and I’ve seen him tear defences apart at that level,’ said Baldock. ‘But we need to see games out better. We’re bitterly disappointed to give away two sloppy goals.’ Nonetheless, Chris Wilder’s side, widely tipped to repeat last season’s play-off push, represented a tough baptism for Potter, who admitted he was still on a venture into the unknown. It’s the same for his team after relegation from the Premier League. Potter’s message is simply to approach it positively. ‘You have to trust, be brave and not be afraid of making mistakes,’ he said. Dhanda confirmed: ‘His attitude is: if you lose the ball, get on it again and make it right.’ Despite more outs than ins this summer, with sales far exceeding purchases, the mistake the rest of the Championship would make is to under-estimate Swansea’s chances as an outside bet to return to the top flight."
"Derby are back in the hunt for Martyn Waghorn after they matched Middlesbrough’s bid of £5million for the Ipswich striker. Derby moved quick on Sunday afternoon after Middlesbrough had been given the opportunity to speak with Waghorn after agreeing a deal with Ipswich. Derby’s late offer has also been accepted. The 28-year-old had looked set to join Middlesbrough but is now understood to be close to agreeing personal terms with Derby and is expected to attend a medical at the club’s Moor Farm training complex on Monday. Sportsmail understands that when Derby first showed they were serious about making an offer last month Waghorn was keen on the idea of working for new manager Frank Lampard. Derby were in advanced negotiations at the end of last month but talks broke down after they couldn’t meet Ipswich’s £10m valuation of the striker. Waghorn scored 16 Championship goals and provided 11 assists last season following his £250,000 move to Ipswich from Rangers Sportsmail also understands that Ipswich dropped their valuation of Waghorn in order to quickly cover the cost of signing Shrewsbury’s Jon Nolan and Toto Nsiala who are joining the club after a combined bid of £1.5m was accepted for the pair. The money from the Waghorn deal will also give Ipswich manager Paul Hurst extra funds to go after Accrington striker Kayden Jackson after the League One club valued him at £2.5m. Hurst is also interested in bringing Cardiff’s Omar Bogle to Portman Road on loan although the Premier League side would prefer to sell the striker after buying him from Wigan for £1m last year. Birmingham have been offered the chance to make an offer for Bogle. "
"Bournemouth have agreed a deal for defender Jack Simpson to go on loan to Rangers but are waiting to check on Nathan Ake's fitness first after he picked up an injury.  Bournemouth expect to sign Jefferson Lerma from Levante on Monday for £25m, making him their record signing. Simpson, 21, has impressed in pre-season and Howe is keen for him to gain first-team experience this season. Rangers boss Steven Gerrard has overhauled his defence this summer, bringing in centre-backs Nikola Katic and Connor Goldson. However, the former Liverpool midfielder wants one more defender, and believes left-sided Simpson will complement his existing options well.   Simpson has made three appearances for Bournmeouth, scoring once, and spent time on loan at non-league Totton in 2015.  Lerma played 89 times for Levante and featured in all of Colombia's World Cup games, including their last 16 defeat to England. The fee eclipses the £20m Bournemouth paid for Nathan Ake last summer and takes manager Eddie Howe's summer spend to £47m.  "
"Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is due to re-join Aston Villa on loan. The centre-back spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and made five appearances in the Championship. Tuanzebe, 20, has featured for the United first-team during pre-season but would be unlikely to feature regularly should he remain at Old Trafford.  Meanwhile, Tuanzebe's United teammate Demetri Mitchell is wanted back by Hearts. Mitchell gained valuable experience with the Scottish Premiership club last campaign.  Villa are also keen on Millwall midfielder George Saville but will face competition from Leeds. Villa are expecting a bid from Tottenham for Jack Grealish this week, with Mauricio Pochettino's side having been heavily linked with the 22-year-old throughout the transfer window. "
"Eddie Jones took England training on Sunday morning on the second day of their summer training camp at the Lensbury Club in Teddington. Jones has his squad together to work on routines and drills, with England not set to play another fixture until November's autumn internationals. Despite the heatwave in England continuing, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees  in south-west London on Sunday morning, Jones allowed no let up in the intensity of training. Jones remains under a certain amount of pressure following a run of six successive defeats earlier this year, which saw them finish fifth in the Six Nations and lose the June tour of South Africa. The rot was stopped when England won the final game of the South African series, but World Cup winning former international says Jones remains under the cosh.  He told the Daily Star: 'Winning that final test means England now have a starting point to try and build some momentum, but the pressure is still ramped up on Eddie and the team. 'They have to win all the three autumn internationals against big southern hemisphere rivals. By then you will be technically in a World Cup year and if they lose them they will be in a really bad place.'  England will play South Africa, New Zealand and Australia at Twickenham in November, as well as Japan, who host the World Cup in 2019.   And Jones sprung some surprises in his 44-man squad selection, including recalling Chris Ashton for the first time since 2016. The 31-year-old, who has not scored an international try since 2014, was invited back into the set-up after returning to the Premiership from French side Toulon with Jones saying his move to Sale Sharks proved he had 'the right attitude'.  Another notable participant was Danny Cirpriani. The 30-year-old fly-half also found himself out of favour for much of Jones' regime, but earned a shot at redemption after impressing against the Barbarians and South Africa."
"Laura Kenny defied another sleepless night to win her second gold medal at the European Championships in Glasgow with victory in the women's elimination race. Motherhood and medals do not always mix and the quadruple Olympic champion was served a timely reminder of her priorities by baby son Albie at the flat she shares with husband and fellow track star Jason Kenny on Saturday night. 'I was up five times last night - and he didn't actually fall asleep until nine o'clock, the little sod,' laughed Kenny after seeing off Germany's Anna Knauer in the final head to head for her 12th career continental gold. 'But you get used to it. I don't even feel like I've had a lack of sleep any more - I just come in and get on with it.' All evidence suggests the 26-year-old's new work-life balance is serving her well, having won her first Glasgow gold as part of the GB team pursuit squad, with the prospect of the madison alongside Scot Katie Archibald to come. Both her dominant performance and her evident enthusiasm for her new role bodes well for the long haul towards Tokyo 2020, and is a position Kenny never thought she would face when she was called up for her first European Championships in Poland in 2010. A late replacement for the injured Joanna Rowsell-Shand, a then 18-year-old Kenny marked her senior GB debut in Pruszkow with a gold medal as part of the team pursuit squad. 'Poland was the beginning for me,' added Kenny. 'If you'd asked me then if I'd be a mum with four Olympic and 12 European gold medals I would have said no, that's not the way my life is going to pan out. 'Pre-Rio I used to go home if I'd had a bad session and that was all I would think about, whereas now I don't have time to think about anything else other than Albie. 'He's running around like you wouldn't believe at the minute. I'm making sure he's not pulling the wires out of the wall or sticking things in plug sockets, rather than thinking about riding around in circles.' Kenny will have her chance to complete a hat-trick of Glasgow gold medals when she teams up with Archibald in the madison when the track programme concludes on Tuesday. 'They're going to go mad for Katie so it will be a great atmosphere,' said Kenny. 'I'm glad I've done a group race now. It was a good standard so now I know where I'm actually going.'"
"Ireland's first Hockey World Cup final ended in defeat as favourites Holland retained their title with an emphatic 6-0 victory in London. The Irish team, the second lowest ranked country in the competition, upset the odds to reach the last two but were unable to produce a fairy-tale ending at the Lee Valley Hockey Centre. Goals from Lidewij Welten, Kelly Jonker, Kitty van Male, Malou Pheninckx, Marloes Keetels and Caia van Maasakker capped a dominant performance from the Dutch as they won the competition for a record eighth time. Graham Shaw's underdogs began brightly but did not manage a shot at goal until the final quarter and the tournament favourites - who lifted the trophy on home soil four years ago - soon showed their superiority. Welten put Alyson Annan's team ahead in the seventh minute, turning to hit a powerful shot through a crowded circle and past Irish goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran at the near post. Jonker found the bottom-left corner to double the lead in the 19th minute, while superb blocks from Irish pair Shirley McCay and Roisin Upton following penalty corners prevented further goals. The free-scoring Dutch, who registered 29 goals in five matches to reach the final, put the result beyond doubt with two quickfire goals in the final stages of the second period. Tournament top scorer Van Male smashed in her eighth of the competition from close range and, moments later, Pheninckx was allowed too much space to fire the ball high into the net. Shaw called for his players to 'be proud' at half-time but they were outclassed by the world's top-ranked team and powerless to stop Keetels tapping home a fifth and Van Maasakker adding another from a penalty corner. Earlier on Sunday, Spain beat Australia 3-1 in the bronze medal match."
"Germany's Alexander Zverev beat Australian teenager Alex de Minaur 6-2 6-4 to defend his Citi Open title in Washington on Sunday. Zverev' s serve played a big role in the victory, his third of the year, as the world No 3 won all but two of his first-serve points in the final, which lasted 74 minutes. The 21-year-old German, now winner of nine career victories, became the tournament's first repeat champion since Argentine Juan Martin del Potro prevailed in 2008-09. An obviously struggling De Minaur dropped the opening four games of the first set, but fought back in second. The Australian drew the crowd's applause when he hit an inside-in winner to hold for 3-4, after saving three break points to avoid a double-break deficit. He saved two match points on his own serve at 3-5 but Zverev clinched the victory when De Minaur hit a backhand into the net in the next game. Although beaten, De Minaur, once ranked 208 in the world, will soar into the top 50 for the first time when the new rankings are produced on Monday, rising 27 spots to number 45. "
"Here are the five most memorable England Tests PAUL NEWMAN has covered since he became Sportsmail cricket correspondent in 2007...  v Australia, Sydney January 2011 The game that saw Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower’s England side complete their 3-1 victory over Michael Clarke’s men with an incredible three victories by an innings to win the Ashes in Australia.  As we waited for the final wicket, I remember the English journalists looking around at each other, smiling and making sure the windows of the old SCG press box were open so we could soak up the atmosphere.   v Australia, Trent Bridge August 2015 Australia again because every victory against them is special and there were few more dramatic than Trent Bridge three years ago when Stuart Broad posted incredible figures of eight for 15 as the Aussies were demolished for 60.  That look of amazement on Broad’s face when Ben Stokes took a stunning slip catch has gone down in Ashes legend.   v India, Edgbaston August 2018 This first Test had everything at a time when the longest and best form of the game is under threat and the ECB are not helping by giving the impression the game is doomed and needs pathetic gimmicks like The Hundred to rescue it.  It had everything, administrators please note, because ball was on top of bat for most of the time apart from an extraordinary display of conquering conditions that were alien to him by Virat Kohli. v South Africa, Cape Town January 2016 On the list for the most breathtaking double hundred from Ben Stokes and an emotional century from Jonny Bairstow.  The pair put on 399 with Stokes showing what a rare talent he is and Bairstow looking to the skies in memory of his late father David when he reached three figures.  v India, Chennai December 2008 The Mumbai terrorist attack meant we all came home but after considerable work by then captain Kevin Pietersen and team director Hugh Morris, England returned to India late in 2008 for a two-Test series.  And what better than Mumbai boy Sachin Tendulkar scoring an unbeaten century as India chased 387 to win the first Test. It was both symbolic and significant and the game really was the winner.  "
"TJ Dillashaw strengthened his claims to being the greatest bantamweight fighter of all time with his second knockout win over adversary, Cody Garbrandt, in the main event of UFC 227 in Los Angeles on Saturday night. Although Garbrandt's demise in their first bout had been put down to a back injury, Dillashaw manage to improve on the second-round win with a first-round stoppage. After securing the first title defence of his second title reign, Dillashaw agreed to a fight with Henry Cejudo, who called for the winner of the bantamweight title fight following his dethroning of Demetrious Johnson earlier in the co-main event. The turning point of the fight took place when it looked as though Garbrandt had caught the champion flush, which Dillashaw noted in his post-fight interview. 'He got me good. But nothing (significant enough) that I wasn't there,' he told Joe Rogan after the fight. Just when it looked as though Garbrandt had his foe hurt, however, Dillashaw fired back landing two right hands that knocked the challenger to the ground. He trapped Garbrandt's arm as he turtled up, landing elbows. He continued to swarm Garbrandt as he got back to his feet, connecting with a big knee that spelled the beginning of the end for Garbrandt. In the co-main event, Cejudo ended the longest title reign in UFC history with a split decision win over Demetrious Johnson, calling on the wrestling skills that won him an Olympic gold medal to get the job done in the rematch. Following what will be remembered as the greatest title fight in the history of the weight division, Cejudo called for a showdown with the winner of the main event. 'The winner of this next fight, I want to fight that guy. DJ didn't go up. I'm going up! I want that belt too!' said Cejudo in his post-fight interview. In the early exchanges, Cejudo appeared to roll his ankle, which caused him some trouble as Johnson pressed forward and chipped away at his lead leg. After chasing much of the opening 10 minutes, he scored a takedown at the end of the second round. Having had success with his wrestling, the Olympic gold medalist repeated the strategy in the third and fourth rounds; he successfully took 'Mighty Mouse' down towards the end of the fourth after taking the brunt of the damage in the striking back and forth. Cejudo threatened with multiple takedowns in the final round in the face of Johnson's leg kicks. The duo finished out the epic battle exchanging with each other in the pocket as the final bell sounded. Meanwhile, Renato 'Moicano' Carneiro called for a rematch with Brian Ortega following his first-round dispatch of perennial title contender, Cub Swanson. The promising Brazilian pushed his stock to a whole new level as he dropped Swanson with a jab before finishing him with a rear-naked choke. Speaking after the win, 'Moicano' urged the UFC to give him a chance to avenge the sole loss of his career. He was winning on the judges' scorecards before Ortega finished him with a patented guillotine in the final round of their featherweight clash two years ago. Earlier, JJ Aldrich highlighted a weakness in jiu-jitsu expert Polyana Viana's game as she outstruck her to win a unanimous decision, handing the Brazilian her second career loss in the process. Aldrich, who is a training partner of strawweight champion Rose Namajunas, forced Viana to pull guard in a effort to get the fight on her terms late on. Aldrich's willingness to clinch with the grappling ace underlined her confidence, even though she entered the bout as an underdog. Ranked veteran Thiago Santos proved too much for newcomer Kevin Holland in their entertaining middleweight contest, which opened the event's main card. Holland's unorthodox offence caused the Brazilian some difficulty over the 15 minutes. At one stage, the debutant attempted a jumping omaplata and showcased some slick sweeps in the second round and reversed position with a kimura. Santo's aggressive ground and pound likely won him the nod on the judges' scorecards. He waded in on his opponent every time he took top position, and was the clear winner after three rounds Brett Johns showed tremendous heart despite dropping his second consecutive decision, this time to highly ranked Brazilian, Pedro Munhoz. The Welshman fought valiantly even though he was dropped on several occasions with body shots and chopping leg kicks. He evaded Munhoz's patented guillotine on several occasions, and no doubt won a lot of fans with his gritty display."
"Catalans Dragons produced a sensational performance to hammer St Helens 35-16 and book their place in the Challenge Cup final in one of the biggest shocks in the competition's recent history. Saints finished Super League's regular season 10 points clear of the rest but they had no answer to the inspired Dragons as the French side reached Wembley for only the second time. Catalans coach Steve McNamara urged his players to seize the moment with the club's first silverware in sight and they responded in a remarkably one-sided opening 40 minutes. St Helens were already rocking when Morgan Knowles was sin-binned and the Dragons went for the kill with the forward off the field, scoring two tries through Tony Gigot and Ben Garcia to take a stunning 27-0 lead into half-time. Saints came out firing in the second half but their decade-long wait to get their hands on the Challenge Cup goes on despite Mark Percival's double and a try from Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook. The result was as unexpected as the only previous time the Dragons reached Wembley in 2007 with victory over Wigan. On that occasion St Helens were far too strong in the showpiece as they secured the second of a hat-trick of Challenge Cups, but Catalans turned the tables in Sunday's double-header at Bolton. There was little sign of the drama to come when prop Luke Thompson made a rampaging break in the opening minutes. But the attack came to nothing and it was Catalans who posted the first points through Josh Drinkwater's penalty from in front of the sticks. Super League's runaway leaders St Helens struggled for any kind of rhythm in the first quarter as the Dragons grew in confidence. That belief was evident when they turned down the offer of another two points from a penalty and went in search of the game's opening try, which they duly claimed through Lewis Tierney's flying finish in the corner. Drinkwater added the extras from the touchline to make it 8-0 and things continued to go the French outfit's way as James Roby lost the ball over the line at the end of Saints' best attack of the half. It proved to be only brief hope for the St Helens fans as the Dragons took control in ruthless fashion as half-time approached. Drinkwater's delayed short ball put Garcia over from close range before Gigot caught Saints napping with a cheeky drop goal from right in front. St Helens were still in the match at 13-0 but Knowles' yellow card proved to be the pivotal moment. Drinkwater slotted over another two points after Knowles was penalised for a high tackle on Kenny Edwards and Gigot backed up Benjamin Jullien's break to score Catalans' third try. Garcia piled more misery on Saints by cruising over out wide for his second and Drinkwater's third penalty just after the break made it 29-0. The tie was over as a contest but St Helens did at least get on the board when Percival raced over in the corner after quick hands from Ben Barba. Justin Holbrook's side hinted at an unlikely comeback after McCarthy-Scarsbrook powered his way over and Danny Richardson added his first goal of the afternoon. But Sam Moa ran over the top of Theo Fages to score and put the result beyond any doubt, ensuring Percival's finish out wide was mere consolation for the shell-shocked Saints."
"Australian Steve Price will lead Warrington out at Wembley in his first season as a Super League head coach after watching his side overcome struggling Leeds 48-12 at Bolton. Price took over a Wolves team that finished in the bottom four last season but now has realistic hopes of completing the double. Wingers Josh Charnley and Tom Lineham each grabbed two tries and stand-off Kevin Brown scored the 150th of his career on his 400th appearance as Price's men set up a meeting with surprise finalists Catalans Dragons in the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup final on August 25. The teams will meet at the Halliwell Jones Stadium on Friday night for a dress rehearsal in the opening round of the Super 8s. While Warrington can savour a fifth Wembley appearance in the last 10 years, Leeds will be able to concentrate on their fight for survival via the Qualifiers and, on this showing, they can take nothing for granted. Still coming to terms with the Dragons' stunning 35-16 destruction of St Helens in the first semi-final, the sell-out 26,086 crowd at Bolton might have sensed another upset when Leeds scored the opening try through Ryan Hall but order was restored long before the end of the double-header. Warrington made the more impressive start and, after darting runs from hooker Daryl Clark and scrum-half Tyrone Roberts, they opened the scoring with a 10th-minute penalty goal from Roberts, the first of his eight successful kicks at goal. Hall, one of seven fit-again players brought back into the Leeds side, struck with the first try, evading his opposite number Charnley with a run from dummy half and using his brute force to take two other defenders over the line with him.   Liam Sutcliffe's conversion put the Rhinos into a 6-2 lead and they were attacking promisingly once more when they lost possession near the Wolves tryline, and Lineham scored a breakaway try through the heart of the Leeds defence to bring the scores level. Roberts added the conversion to nudge Warrington back in front and they ran in three further tries before the break to establish a stranglehold. Centre Toby King outjumped Hall to collect the ball from Roberts' high kick to get Charnley over for his first try and Brown jinked his way over for his landmark score before burly substitute Ben Murdoch-Masila proved unstoppable from 20 metres out. Trailing 26-6 at the break, prop Adam Cuthbertson gave the Rhinos a glimmer of renewed hope when he took Brad Dwyer's pass to crash over for his side's second try and scrum-half Richie Myler claimed another shortly afterwards only to be brought back for a forward pass. The Rhinos' spirits were finally broken on 57 minutes when man of the match Clark broke clear in midfield and sent Charnley racing over for his second try and Toby King piled on the agony with a long-range effort. Roberts kept the scoreboard ticking over with another penalty but lost his 100 per cent record when he failed to convert the Wolves' seventh scored by centre Bryson Goodwin six minutes from the end. Warrington might have brought up the half-century after Lineham went 80 metres for his second try but replacement marksman Ben Westwood missed the conversion from in front of the posts.   "
"There was French heartbreak for trainer George Scott on Sunday when the Newmarket handler was denied his first Group 1 prize by the dramatic record-breaking late charge of Polydream in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. The Scott-trained James Garfield, sporting the blinkers for the first time, had looked to steal a march on his rivals under a bold front-running ride from Frankie Dettori with the duo holding a useful advantage at the furlong marker. However, Maxime Guyon produced an impressive turn of foot aboard Polydream to wrestle the prize from Dettori's grasp in the dying strides and hand trainer Freddie Head a record seventh success in the high summer feature. The agonising defeat left a proud, but disappointed Scott, struggling for words. He said: 'He has run an incredible race, but my heart is broken. 'What a warrior James Garfield is and I am so proud of the race he has run. My staff at home have done a great job with him as he is quite high maintenance, but we can re-plan his campaign now after a performance like that. 'We have lots to look forward to and I wouldn't mind coming back to six furlongs now as he has enjoyed being ridden aggressively, although there is a seven furlong race on Arc day which could suit as well.'  Dettori was equally philosophical after the narrow reverse: 'It was an amazing run and he felt back to his best. It is a huge shame he didn't win, but the blinkers sharpened him up and he's run a huge race.'  British raiders were also third and fourth with The Tin Man and Librisa Breeze running terrific races to reach the places."

"Read all the very latest news with our transfer centre PRE-SEASON 2018: Check out your club's fixtures and results Keep up-to-date with every Premier League transfer deal completed    Keeping on top of all the new Premier League kits released throughout the summer is not as easy as it used to be. Long gone is the era when teams only had two strips and even the home kit lasted two seasons.  Now you can expect around three new kits every summer and they add up stretched across 20 teams. So keep track with them all as they are released with our guide and verdict on all the designs coming to a Premier League ground near you soon...  Home kit It's a new era at Arsenal and while they hope for success under new manager Unai Emery, Arsene Wenger's replacement cannot be at fault for its messy looking start. Arsenal's first home strip under the Emery has, at best, received mixed reaction from Gunners supporters and it is easy to see why. You arguably have to go back nearly 25 years for the last time Arsenal featured as much white on the shoulders and sleeves combined. Done correctly it should not have been a problem but the thin red stripes on the sleeves do nothing to compliment the design. Should the good times come rolling back it may become a cult classic, otherwise this one won't be fondly remembered. HOME KIT VERDICT: 5/10  Away kit If Arsenal supporters are not happy with their home shirt then they may take comfort in a slightly better offering with their away strip. Granted, it is not the most striking kit produced for the Gunners in recent years but there will be far blander shirts released this summer, and it does look a touch better than the similar looking 'Dennis the Menace' strip from 2007-08. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Pop quiz. What links Arsenal's away strip and their third kit? The answer is Herbert Chapman and his WM formation from the 1930s. Confused? Take a closer look at the strips. While the away version has an 'M' stitched into it, the third kit has the attacking concept of the formation with the 'W'. Whether that gimmick is enough to win over Arsenal fans to the club's first green kit since 1983 is another matter. We've certainly seen worse though. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home kit and Away kit It's Brighton, it's blue and white stripes but there is still a big departure from last season's strip. The blue shoulders have made way for white, while the actual stripes are thicker. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff but it is at least a different offering from Nike. There's a retro twist to Brighton's away kit which is all green as a tribute to the strip won by the club when it was under the guise of Brighton United between 1898-99. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit Ah, the old switcheroo trick from Umbro, in football's laziest attempt to add some form of change to a team that play in stripes. This time it is red that features as the central stripe colour on Bournemouth's home kit, but at least there are a few added tweaks elsewhere. All black sleeves and limited gold trim are a nice addition to what is otherwise a standard Cherris home shirt. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Away kit No thrills from Bournemouth regarding their away strip for next term as they opt for a fairly simple white kit with navy shorts. Small details include stripes stitched into the kit and salmon pink trim on the sleeves - which seem more like an Umbro advertisement than anything else. It does the job of providing alternate colours to the club's traditional colours but that won't stop it becoming a forgettable kit by the time next May comes round. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Third kit Forget the away kit, Bournemouth - you won't be needing that anytime soon. That is because in the third strip the Cherries have all they need. The beach glass colour (no seriously, that is what it is called) looks striking with its tonal pattern on the front of the chest, making the away design looking even more bland than it already is. One negative is perhaps the third strip needed a darker colour to really draw it away from the away kit, but we can let good designs bypass this issue. Thumbs up to the team at Umbro. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Home kit The chances are Burnley will not be able to match their heroics last season when they stunned just about everyone to finish seventh - or as it is now called - best of the rest. So how do Puma celebrate what looks like being the major high point of their recent history? By releasing a new home kit that is close to identical as last season's strip. That's not even the worst part. Gambling sponsorships tend to make a shirt ugly anyway but when more than one language is squeezed onto a kit, it makes you start thinking of how long it will be before football shirts take a similar look to racing driver overalls. HOME KIT VERDICT: 5/10  Away kit Compared with the rest of the Premier League away kits this really is not that special, yet this may still be Burnley's best strip available this season. The black kit features a honeycomb print which becomes more prominent lower down the shirt and adds some form of design to what otherwise would have been a boring old black kit. Puma have ignored trying to weave it into the shorts but for the average fan buying it that is not going to be a problem. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Third kit Due to their Europa League qualifier with Aberdeen, Burnley were forced to rush out the unveiling of their third kit. And by the look of things, Puma were forced to rush out a design for it too. It's white with a hint of...well, white and complimented by... even more white. Throw in that horror show of a sponsor logo and you have one of the most boring and worst strips released this summer. Not even a tonal 'V' on the front is saving this. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 4/10 Home kit An all-blue kit may seem typically Cardiff City, but this is a whole different look to the one adopted by the Welsh outfit from the last time they were in the Premier League four years ago. This time there is no red kit nonsense or the hysteria around it, but compared to last season there is hardly any difference at all. Not necessarily a bad thing and there is a slight difference in terms of the this year's kit featuring a subtle two-tone showing of blue hoops. Otherwise this is pretty much the same Cardiff kit since they ditched Project Red. HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Away kit No massive design changes on the away strip either for Cardiff City, with adidas offering a similar template to that of the home strip. It being a grey kit with a standard template should make this kit rubbish, but that is not the case. The blue trim compliments the strip well, and the minor additions of thin grey stripes helps lift the kit out of blandness. Not bad. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit  It's not very often you see a splash of design on a Chelsea strip, but maybe Nike have found just the right balance for the 2018-19 season. The Blues' new home kit maintains the key details - blue shirts and shorts with white socks - but it's the invasion of the trim colours on the front of the strip that raises the eyebrows. The subtle but certainly noticeable white and red stripes that flash across the front and reverse of the kit certainly mark a departure from safe and simple in the design stakes. Red may have last featured on a strip as recent as 2016 but it doesn't happen too often these days. Fans are divided but at the very least it blends in well with the sponsor logo... HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit Chelsea's away strips over the last two or three years have been rather bland with its selection of black and whites. So the return of yellow to the strip is very much welcome, even if it is to just add some colour to the west London side when they are on the road. It looks very similar to the kit worn during the title winning 2014-15 campaign, and seeing as its their best away design since then, you wonder why they bothered to change it at all. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home kit Crystal Palace are more liberal than most teams that feature two predominant colours when it comes to mixing up their home kit, and 2018-19 will prove another change of direction. Stripes remain, and of course they are red and blue, but the cut of them is thicker. In addition the red stripe will gradually fade to blue going down the shirt. Yellow trim helps compliment the finish, with Puma's first kit for the club proving innovative and it has been well received by fans. It's just a shame about the ugly sponsor. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Away kit Not only have Puma pleased Palace supporters with their home kit but they have done the double with a classy away design too. For a certain generation it may as well be the home kit, as Palace played at Selhurst Park in white strip with a red and blue sash from the mid 1970s for nearly a decade. There was no need to make stylistic changes like with the home shirt and as a result the Eagles have two excellent strips for the new campaign. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home Kit Not much went right for Everton over the 2017-18 campaign but there is hope for the Toffees that brighter days lie ahead in the new season. For a start, supporters are sure to be delighted with their new home strip. But then considering it was made as a result of a fan consultation it is hardly a surprise. Umbro collaborated with fans to understand their preferences on colour, collar and other design features. As good as the finished article looks, it is odd to see the diamond Umbro template make a return to the sleeves. It was last seen on a strip that was worn when Everton were incredibly fortunate not to be relegated in 1998. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away Kit Everton have dabbled with pink a couple of times in the last decade but on this occasion it does not do enough to salvage an otherwise bland away strip. Grey is hardly the most inspiring of primary options for a colour on an away kit and it is not lifted much by the black sleeves that accompany it. The pink trim is a welcome feature and prevents THE KIT being flat out boring, but unless the Toffees end up wearing it in a 6-0 thrashing of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge it is unlikely to be well remembered, and more likely soon forgotten. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home Kit Fulham are back in the Premier League and to celebrate a return to the top flight, adidas have produced a home kit for everyone to celebrate like it is 1999. The late 1990s saw the start of the Cottagers' rapid rise up the ranks that would eventually lead to them getting promoted to the Premier League in 2001. The strip from the 90s had a hooped feature across the front and they are now back for the first time since those heady days under Kevin Keegan and then later Jean Tigana. It's a Pizza Hut logo short of completing that whole memorable journey of that period but either way it is sure to go down well with supporters. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Away Kit The home kit is where the originality ends for Fulham though, as they have been given an away strip that shares identical templates to many other clubs. It actually looks good with the white trim complimenting the various navy blue colours on the display. Then someone stuck a big yellow betting logo on the front of it. Stick with the home shirt. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home Kit Same old for Huddersfield right? Blue and white stripes job done. Well not exactly. Umbro have hardly pushed the boat out in terms of design, but they have not had to. For the first time in almost 50 years the Terrier will appear on the club badge and that is worthy enough of a reason to give an old Huddersfield favourite a traditional design and colours. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Away kit Much like the home kit, no chances have been taken by Umbro with what is being called an 'alternative strip' as the tried and trusted red and black show off the change colours. Last season's retro design has been shelved before it makes a possible reintroduction for the 2038-39 season following its next orbit in the retro kit stakes. So for now its just the home kit template with familiar away colours. Good enough for Terriers supporters but nothing to excite a casual. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home Kit A new team is behind the latest Leicester City strips for the 2018-19 season, with adidas supplying the Foxes for the first time in their history. You would not have guessed that too easily though looking at the new home kit, which in truth has hardly changed at all since that Premier League title winning campaign in 2015-16. The only notable alteration to the shirt sees white adidas stripes replace the Puma gold on the shoulders alongside a v-neck collar. Otherwise, the socks have a touch more white in what is another all-blue kit. Nothing to turn the heads of outsiders but it should be a hit with Foxes fans.  HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away Kit This looks like being the standard adidas away kit template for the season, as the design is exactly the same as Cardiff City's who unveiled their away strip earlier in the summer. The only differences then are the slightly darker grey colours, the orange trim and of course the monochrome Leicester badge which would not have been a good look on a Cardiff shirt. Otherwise this review should probably have just read 'see Cardiff'. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Already having a standard templated away kit, adidas have sadly not offered much improvement on making a third kit for Leicester. Admittedly there is not much to really criticise. The Foxes have always had white as a traditional away colour and the blue shoulders at least steer the design away from just being an all-white bore. But third kits offer a chance for a bit of flair and adidas have failed to accept the challenge. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home Kit There are not too many ways you can change an-all red kit but in a world where the commercial arm of football clubs demand at least two new strips to sell every year, Liverpool seem to year-on-year get the balance right. No shocks once more with the home strip. It's red, albeit judging by the promotional pictures a slightly darker shade than usual. Trim remains white along with the club badge that featured in yellow for the 2017-18 campaign. A stylish buttoned collar is a welcome addition and back for the first time in five years. No thrills stuff but no complaints either. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit What is it with New Balance, and formerly Warrior? Why do they have to keep releasing these garish away strips for Liverpool that even the 1990s would turn their nose up at in disgust. This is not the worst of them from over the years but it would look much more at home as a training top or even a goalkeeper's shirt. The only explanation is that former Mexico keeper Jorge Campos has sneaked his way into the design team at New Balance. Either way, thumbs down. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 4/10 Third kit Now that is more like it from New Balance who have somehow managed to add some style to the the concept of a white and grey strip. It was a pretty simple solution but it was to model Liverpool's third strip off the kits from the 1980s, although not going as far as actually copying. The third kit is subtle, and stylish and more than makes up for the purple monstrosity. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home kit Believe it or not there is almost always a change to the predominant colours in a Manchester City kit and this summer's is no different. It comes in the socks which will switch from light blue to navy - in homage to the double promotion winning seasons and to return to the Premier League in 2000 and the club's first top flight title in 1937. City fans will not want to be reminded that on both occasions, relegation followed a year later. Not that we are suggesting Pep Guardiola's side are going down next season. There is more chance of City fans embracing the Champions League anthem and singing along with high acclaim for UEFA. This is a well designed strip though from the slightly darker trim on the arms to the added button on the neck. City are not only the team to beat on the pitch but in the fashion stakes too. HOME KIT VERDICT: 9/10 Away kit Nike are often accused of 'phoning it in' when it comes to designing kits but their latest away strip for Manchester City is proof that they can deliver the goods when they are not too busy playing on the ping-pong table near their work desks. Apparently this strip is a nod to the kit that earned them promotion from the third tier back in 1999. Colours aside, it looks nothing like it but that does not matter because with pin stripes and a pair of ultra bright socks begging to be caked in mud, this is a belter. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 9/10  Home kit Brave move form adidas. They could have quite easily have just designed a plain red shirt, stuck their stripes on to provide a return of black trim to Manchester United, then sit back and count the incoming coins.  But by putting a train track graphic on the shirt in reference to Newton Heath origins (whatever happened to the green and gold protests?) to mark 140 years (not a milestone) adidas may have a gone a step too far here.  The gradual fade to black down the front of the shirt merges well with the black shor...wait, black shorts! United playing with a red shirt and black shorts combination has been done many times before but only as a change alternative. So since changing the name to Manchester United in 1902, this will be the club's first ever season without white shorts. It's a brave new world at United, top marks to adidas for trying but have they gone too radical with this? HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Manchester United are a club steeped in history and tradition and they've honoured that with the unveiling of one of their new strips for next season. The Red Devils will go back to blue for the 2018-19 campaign when they wear their third kit with a design inspired by the 50th anniversary of the club's historic first European Cup win. The Red Devils wore blue in their defeat of Benfica to become the first English side to win European football's biggest club prize. The gold trim is a stylish touch and as a bonus blends with the sponsor logo. United often produce strong change strips and this is another of those. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 9/10  Home kit We get it, Newcastle play in black and white stripes and that is sacred. So on that note it is a little harsh to criticise Puma for a lack of ideas for a new home kit. But when the only solution offered is to change the shoulder colour to white and the order of the stripes on the front of the kit it feels rather lazy. The biggest departure on the whole strip is the change to white socks, otherwise what is the point? HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away kit It's been nearly a quarter of century since we were dazzled by Kevin Keegan's 'Entertainers'. And while Newcastle fans these days have the manager in Rafa Benitez they want to bring back the good ol' days of the mid-1990s, they don't look like returning to the business end of the Premier League anytime soon without serious financial backing. But there is a crumb of comfort for Toon supporters, with the away kit for the 2018-19 season a near copy of the hooped design worn during the 1995-96 Premier League campaign when they narrowly missed out on the title. It might not have the likes of David Ginola and Les Ferdinand playing in it, but it is one of the best strips you will see in this campaign. Only a silly betting company logo prevents perfection here. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 9/10 Third kit So how do you top that away kit? Well quite simply you don't and Puma know it. The only way in providing a third strip that will gather any sort of attention is to splash it in an outrageous shade of blue and hope for the best. And you know what? Those folks at Puma have pulled it off. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Home kit Under Armour are in their third season supplying Southampton kits now and credit where it is due, have resisted the urge to just simply go through the usual motions of switching the colour of the red and white stripes. In fact last season they ditched the stripes all together. But it is back to familiarity for Saints fans as the stripes return complete with an all-red shoulder and sleeves combo. It is not groundbreaking but it is acceptable looking and wildly different from the previous season. Therefore a thumbs up from us. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Away kit Officially, this kit takes 'inspiration' from the strip worn in the 1976 FA Cup final victory over Manchester United. That is a bit cheeky from Southampton as it is no closer to the kit than their many other yellow and blue strips released from over the years. Still, this is their first yellow and blue change strip in the Premier League since 2005 and if we have learnt anything from the Swedish national team and to a slightly lesser extent Italian side Parma, it is very hard to get a yellow and blue kit wrong. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Third kit And so Southampton become the first team to release their new home kit for the 2019-20 season, with a...wait this is a change strip? Now admittedly, and rather frustratingly this is a good design from Under Armour and one might have thought with a few tweaks they could have banked it and released it as next season's home strip instead. But nope it has been relegated to third strip status and as a 'change kit' offers very little change at all to the home shirt aside from the absence of white stripes. What a waste. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Home kit Tottenham Hotspur were the last team to unveil a new kit ahead of the 2018-19 season but this is not one of those cases of saving the best to last. Admittedly, the way the shirt blends into the shorts is a nice touch but as a stand alone shirt it looks rather tacky. The average Spurs fan has a dilemma. Risk the tacky look or match it with the shorts and walk into dangerous territory of being a full-kit-wa...wally. The team does not fully escape the problem. In Europe Spurs play with white shorts, so unless the club release a dedicated European kit (don't rule it out, someone has to pay for the stadium) the club are going to have a rather messy strip in the Champions League next term. HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away kit Now Spurs have the opposite problem to that of the home kit. As a stand alone shirt this is not a bad looking away design. The lighter blue shoulders are a neat addition to the navy strip but that is where the compliments end. The shoulder colours carry over to the shorts and socks appear even lighter. Many responses on the unveiling compared the kit to looking like pyjamas. So if Tottenham are caught napping on their travels next term, you have a go to excuse already made Spurs fans. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home kit Watford have often been an accumulator breaker for many punters since gaining promotion to the Premier League  with their wild inconsistency. How many sides go unbeaten at the start of the season before losing 6-0 at home against Manchester City?  So adidas have celebrated this wild contrast by giving the Hornets a black and yellow striped kit for the new season. Unprecedented? Not quite. There was the more garish thin hoops on their Premier League return in 2015 but a more suitable link would be the decade between 1914 and 1923 when they wore black and white stripes. If a team that played in stripes all the time produced it, this would be boring. But this is a radical step on a Watford strip and it looks the part. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit It's the same adidas template which will feature on many Premier League away kits this term, yet Watford may have the best of the bunch. Managing to avoid the drab grey as a primary colour, the all-green strip features various shades. It's something different from adidas, even if its skeleton is just the same as everything else out there. The big bonus for Watford fans was every supporter who attended an away game last season picked one up for free. A nice offer and probably the least they deserved having travelled to watch their team score only once on the road in 2018. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home and away kits The template for a West Ham kit was easy to follow for Umbro. Mainly claret but with plenty of blue too. Where in that memo it got altered to just plain claret shirt with a touch of blue trim is anyone's guess. Admittedly it is aesthetically not too bad - a little bland - and what perhaps saves Umbro is that West Ham have played in kits in the past with only a touch of blue - albeit rarely. The navy blue away strip although a similar design comes across a lot more acceptable... until you see the yellow socks. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Third kit If the World Cup taught us anything it is that white change kits have become a bit of a football trope in recent times. Granted, this strip is more of a hint of grey, with faint claret and blue patches on the shoulders at least offering some form of uniqueness. It's not exactly eye-catching, but we can at least forgive the claptrap about the kit being inspired from the early 1990s due to the fact that at it looks a lot different to the other two kits this season... doesn't it Southampton. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit Wolves are back in the Premier League after storming to the Championship title last term but it's all change in the aesthetics front for the Molineux outfit. No don't worry Wolves fans, it is not a sudden change of direction where the team plays in blue and white stripes and adopts a Throstle as part of the badge. Instead it sees adidas move in, and their first major change is to see the club restore a more traditional  golden colour to their strip. It is a simple change to a simple kit - but it will be a winner among fans. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Away kit When you play in gold and black, the need for an away kit is not all that great. But a team needs one anyway, and besides why miss out and let every other club try and rinse supporters dry for up to three replica kits? Onto away strip matters though, it really is a sort of nothingness like many other white away kits even if it is just the West Midlands club's second in the last decade. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 5/10 "
"After the most exhilarating night in his young life and, indeed, the recent history of English football, we might have expected Jordan Pickford to be crawling the walls and running on adrenaline. He had saved brilliantly to deny Colombia's Carlos Bacca and seal England's first ever World Cup penalty shootout win, yet as the country went completely potty, the Everton goalkeeper's night was disarmingly routine. He did not lie in bed reading the internet praise and watching back videos of that crucial save. As mum Sue and girlfriend Megan waited with hordes of family and friends to embrace him, Pickford was even unable to see his loved ones. 'It was actually all relaxed after the game,' Pickford recalls. 'I was up for drug-testing, so I couldn't even go and see my parents and my missus! Then we flew straight back to the base camp. 'I went straight to sleep. I have only seen it back once or twice. I am not lying there watching it. It's nice to look at but it's about looking forward, getting on to the next victory. My phone went completely nuts, though. Ridiculous. My Instagram followers have gone up though!' Pickford lets out a grin. For the 24-year-old England No 1, this has been a life-changing summer. He saw the mighty TV viewing figures and the videos of beer flying through the air in fan parks, from his native North East in Sunderland to the South East in Croydon. In the half-hour Sportsmail spends in his company, his new life emerges as one of posing for selfies with children, sending happy birthday video messages and reliving the mighty summer of 2018.  Taking the long and lonely walk from the halfway line to the goal for the shootout, Pickford shunned memories of past England failures. 'The truth is I get more nervous doing interviews like this! Football doesn't bother me. I just enjoy it. It's when you have to go to clubs and sing and do initiations and all that stuff. That's when I get nervous. 'I felt ready. We had done our homework. Every penalty I had the same routine and I did it exactly how I wanted to do it. I felt very relaxed and felt like I could make it happen for the country. I would think there is less pressure on the goalkeeper than the taker. But I was quite high up in the queue to take one. I would be confident. I know exactly where I would go... but I'm not telling you!' 'The reaction was amazing. We did our bit and put smiles on people's faces. That's what international football should be about. I want to play for England for as long as I can. There is no better feeling. The gaffer believed in me. But you only get one chance in football. I had to grasp it.' It should be remembered that Pickford had only three caps before the World Cup. During his first England meet-up a year earlier, captain Wayne Rooney sent a photograph of Pickford to the goalkeeper's former Sunderland team-mate George Honeyman with the caption: 'He hasn't said a word!' Pickford smiles as he recalls: 'It's going to be daunting, isn't it? Going on the England bus for the first time as a young lad, sat next to the top goalscorer in English history and the captain at the time. Who wouldn't be nervous? 'I was sat opposite him and Jordan Henderson. Wayne was an amazing person to learn from. He always had time to pass on his insight and he texted me during the World Cup with support. Rooney was not the only senior England international to get in touch. Joe Hart sent him good-luck messages, even after he had learned he would not be part of Gareth Southgate's squad. There was scepticism over Southgate's choice to place his faith in Pickford. After straight-forward matches against Tunisia and Panama, the spotlight burned more brightly on the goalkeeper when he conceded a goal against Belgium, as Adnan Januzaj's curling effort eluded his grasp. Gary Neville said on ITV: 'The goalkeeping's a bit strange. He goes with his wrong hand. His feet are up in the air.' Lee Dixon backed Neville's view. Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois then said a taller goalkeeper would have stopped the strike. Pickford smirks. 'My mental side of the game is really strong. It doesn't affect me. Anyone can slate me if they want to. I know if I have played well or badly. I always ask my dad and he tells me straight. Other people don't affect me. It's just about me becoming better. I still call my old goalkeeper coach, Mark Prudhoe at Sunderland, and he's very honest with me. 'On Adnan's goal, it's instinct. You have a split second. It's like boxing. If you go with a left hook, he might come over the top and surprise you with a right hook. My reactions are good. It was such a small margin and if I had saved it, everyone would have been saying, ""What a worldy save!"" People will criticise me because I am on the top stage. But that's where I want to be. It was an unbelievable effort by Adnan... it's just a pity he couldn't do that when he was at Sunderland!' The criticism stirred Pickford. From there, his performances became more dominant and eye-catching with every knockout fixture. Against Colombia, he also made an astonishing fingertip save seconds before the South American side drew level. There was then a collection of stops against Sweden in the quarter-final and he made an outstanding save at the feet of Mario Mandzukic in extra-time against Croatia. 'I spread myself really well for that Croatia one,' he says. 'I grew up watching Peter Schmeichel videos, so there may have been some of that there. As a Sunderland fan, I loved Tommy Sorensen. I watched football but I was a kid who really preferred being out on the street with my mates playing hide and seek! That's me - a bit daft! I was out playing football every day on the Tarmac, diving to make saves. 'As a keeper, you need every tool in the box. You can be technically great but it's all about keeping the ball out the net. You need guts. Mark at Sunderland used to say the job is keeping it out, however scruffy or technically perfect it may be.' Pickford partly appeals to managers due to his versatility. He adapted to Sam Allardyce's more traditional expectations of a goalkeeper with the same poise he demonstrated in Southgate's progressive system. His calmness on the ball set the tone and he, like England's centre backs, retained ice-cool detachment on the ball, even as pressure mounted. New Everton manager Marco Silva will likely have a similar approach. 'You have to adapt,' Pickford says. 'Growing up at Sunderland, I was always involved in possession and outfield work. Under Big Sam, I could kick it for miles if he wanted me to kick it long. He also taught me about game management. 'I have played nearly 200 league games - I have more experience than most people think. The lower leagues were such a help for me - I had loans at places like Alfreton and Darlington. I was taken out of my comfort zone, being battered by strikers at corners. 'I loved those Saturday 3pm games, hearing every word from the terraces. It was more brutal than the Premier League because you heard every last word people said about you - in big stadiums it's just noise.' Pickford's form has triggered speculation of a move, with Chelsea reportedly interested. But his focus is on Everton, where he returned from holiday on Friday and is targeting a top-six finish. He says: 'I just chilled out and went to Greece with my missus. The season is just round the corner so I have cut my holiday short. Manager Marco Silva texted me a few times in the World Cup and I've spoken to our new goalkeeping coach. I feel fresh and I want to improve.' For Everton and England, that can only be good news. Jordan Pickford was speaking at the launch of McDonald's UK's new football sponsorship programme. For further information visit www.mcdonalds.co.uk/football "
"Not content with becoming Manchester City's all-time top goalscorer, Sergio Aguero is continuing to set records at the Etihad Stadium. The Argentine has now broken into the 200 club after netting the opener in the Community Shield against Chelsea on Sunday. He later upped his tally to 201 with the second goal of the game. The goals mean he is now part of a select group to have notched a double ton for a single club in English football, joining a host of legends in the game. Most recently it was Wayne Rooney who joined that list on his way to 253 goals for Manchester United. Before the Everton striker there was Frank Lampard, who reached 211 goals at Chelsea, and Thierry Henry, the only player to net over 200 times for Arsenal. Alan Shearer netted the last of his 206 goals for Newcastle in 2006, a total bettered by one by Matt Le Tissier at Southampton.  Aguero is now the 27th player from a current Premier League club to have surpassed the 200 goal mark for a single side. Dixie Dean leads the way having scored 383 times for Everton between 1925 and 1937, way ahead of Ian Rush's haul of 346 just over half-a-century later across Stanley Park. Liverpool and Manchester United both have four players each to have scored over 200 times, including such legendary names as Roger Hunt, Billy Liddell, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. 1. 548 goals - Johnny Hayward - Yeovil Town (1906-28) 2. 416 goals - Tony Horseman - Wycombe Wanderers (1961-78) 3. 383 goals - Dixie Dean - Everton (1925-37) 4. 379 goals - Arthur Morris - Barnet (1927-37) 5. 351 goals - John Atyeo - Bristol City (1951-66) 6. 346 goals - Ian Rush - Liverpool (1980-87, 1988-96) 7. 345 goals - George Camsell - Middlesbrough (1925-42) 8. 332 goals - Steve Bloomer - Derby County (1892-1905, 1910-13) 9. 326 goals - Vic Watson - West Ham (1920-35) 10. 306 goals - Steve Bull - Wolves (1986-99)  Tony Brown became West Brom's leading all-time scorer with 279 in a 20-year spell, with Arthur Chandler netting 273 for Leicester before the Second World War.  Jimmy Greaves hit the back of the net 266 times for Tottenham between 1961 and 1970, surpassing Bobby Smith's record of 208 before him. Mick Channon hit 228 during two successful spells at Southampton in a 17-year period.  Wolves legend Steve Bull opens the top 10, having scored 306 times between 1986 and 1999.  Ian Rush found the back of the net on a staggering 346 occasions during two trophy-laden spells with Liverpool in the 1980s and 90s and finds himself in sixth place. The top four is made up predominantly of players from before the Second World War - including Dixie Dean, who famously netted 60 league goals in the 1927-28 season for Everton. Leading the way in a league of his own, however, is Johnny Hayward, who scored 548 goals for Yeovil Town in an astonishing 22-year career between 1906 and 1928. Aguero has some way to go to match that record, and given he turns 30 in the summer he will do very well to get anywhere near it. After arriving from Atletico Madrid with a big fee attached to his name in 2011, Aguero duly delivered in style on his debut. He netted twice in a 4-0 win over Swansea, the second a thunderous strike from 30 yards. His crowning moment in a City shirt arrived on the final day of the season, scoring the all-important goal winner against QPR that won the title ahead of arch-rivals Manchester United. Only injuries have prevented him from reaching  200 sooner than in his seventh season at the club. And as he approaches his 30th birthday he has entered the form of his life with 30 goals in 35 appearances already in this campaign. The question now is how much further he can get up that list in the time he has remaining  at the Etihad. 201 - goals scored by Aguero for City. 293 - appearances to reach the landmark. 4 - he reached 30 goals in a season for City for the fourth time in 2017-18. 33 - his highest total in a campaign for City, in 2016-17. 12 - his four goals against Leicester in February marked his 12th hat-trick for City in all competitions. It was also the third time he had scored four or more in a game for them, following October 2014's 4-1 win over Tottenham and his five goals in a 6-1 win over Newcastle 12 months later. 8 - Premier League hat-tricks, a mark bettered only by Alan Shearer (11) and Robbie Fowler (nine). Aguero is one of two current Premier League players on eight hat-tricks, along with Tottenham's Harry Kane, while Michael Owen and Thierry Henry each achieved the same mark. 31 - Aguero has scored against 31 different opponents in the Premier League. 14 - Newcastle are his favourite Premier League opponents, with Aguero scoring 14 goals against them including that five-goal haul and another hat-trick last season. He also has double figures against Tottenham. 6 - he has won six major trophies with City - three Premier League titles and three League Cups - to add to his 2010 Europa League triumph with Atletico Madrid and 2008 Olympic gold medal with Argentina. 177 - City goals scored by Eric Brook, the club's previous record goalscorer By Tom White, Press Association   "
"After 22 years, a new manager will grace Arsenal’s technical area when the club begin their Premier League campaign at home to champions Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium next Sunday. Arsene Wenger is out and Unai Emery, formerly of Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla, has been anointed as his successor. For Arsenal supporters, there will be a tinge of nostalgia for the Wenger era but also excitement as the new regime gathers pace. Here Adam Crafton reveals the secrets of Emery’s revolution, underlining where the Spanish coach could shine and why he could yet be undermined by the uncertainty festering in the boardroom. Eye for detail Emery’s dependance on lengthy video analysis sessions is legendary among his former players. The Spanish winger Joaquin once joked Emery made him watch so many clips that he ran out of popcorn — and the meetings have started in earnest during Arsenal’s pre-season tour. Emery and his coaching staff spend a combined 12 hours editing information that is then presented to players in a condensed 30-minute format. David Villa, who played under Emery at Valencia, has also been managed by Vicente del Bosque, Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone. ‘I always liked Emery’s approach,’ Villa said, in El Maestro, Romain Molina’s authorised biography of Emery. ‘Unai always wanted to make a player better and analyse the opposition point by point so that players have all the information they could wish for. I am grateful for everything he did for me.’ New Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos said that remedial work on the team’s ‘organisation’ began from the very first day, after Arsenal contrived to concede 73 goals in all competitions last season. Emery has also renewed the focus on set-pieces. Juan Mata, his former Valencia player, says Emery is the manager with the highest concentration on set-piece routines and when you consider that the Manchester United playmaker has played for Rafa Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal, it is a statement that speaks volumes for Emery’s attention to detail. Curiously, Emery’s assistant Juan Carlos Carcedo has also plucked certain routines from basketball during his career, in a manner reminiscent to Gareth Southgate and England this summer. The intensity of Emery and his coaching staff is not to everyone’s liking. In France last season, it was reported that superstar Neymar found the video sessions too gruelling, while Hatem Ben Arfa was caught on camera telling Carcedo: ‘You yell too much! Just let us play.’ French newspaper L’Equipe also suggested that the assistant’s criticism on the training ground lacked ‘human warmth’ and became too ‘virulent’ for some players. Yet, as Hector Bellerin pointed out last week, a new-found structure may be just what Arsenal require. The defender said: ‘Arsene Wenger was a manager that led a lot of inspiration from the players. He gave you a lot of freedom. Unai Emery is a bit more tactical. We are going to be more organised on the pitch.’ During their week in Singapore, Arsenal only had one high-intensity tactics session, with the focus predominantly on building fitness and conditioning. But Emery is now accelerating the squad’s development to instil a fast pressing system that will bring his side up to speed with the Premier League’s most modern and progressive sides, such as Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham. Goalkeepers Petr Cech and Bernd Leno will be asked to take higher starting positions, while the team will be expected to press as a pack to recover possession. Arsenal will likely line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, but it becomes a 4-4-2 without the ball and Mesut Ozil in the No 10 role will be told to lead the pressing along with the central striker. The early reaction from the players has been positive and Emery has also held repeated individual talks with players. They know they have a modern manager who has three Europa League titles to his name — and a fourth this season would represent a mightily fine first season. The personal touch Under Wenger, the Arsenal squad became accustomed to learning the team’s starting line-up in the days leading up to the game. It was usually the day before, but sometimes even earlier. Emery is more determined to keep players on their toes, taking the view that every player must be ready on match-day. For pre-season matches, players have been informed of the starting XI on the day of the game. Throughout his career, Emery has striven to develop close personal relationships with players. He has been buoyed by having the vast majority of his star names at his disposal for much of pre-season, while the likes of Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Mauricio Pochettino stagger through to the campaign with patchwork sides. Those early devilish fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea now represent an opportunity to catch their opponents cold. Emery’s command of English is improving with regular lessons and he is also encouraging his Spanish-speaking staff to talk among themselves in English. His female language teacher has even sat pitchside during training sessions to offer support to Emery if he feels it is required. The manager is determined to succeed in the Premier League, having bided his time for the correct offer and previously resisted approaches from West Ham and Everton. Emery has also been known to focus on individual players during pre-match team-talks, where he lists bullet points on a whiteboard but livens it up with stories plucked from the arts. On one occasion at Sevilla, he even invited the club kitman to speak. Emery has a record of recommending books to his players, with Mata often asking for tips when the pair were together at Valencia, while Molina’s biography also reveals that Emery gave his Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico the autobiography of Victor Valdes to aid him through a difficult phase. Rico’s father later thanked Emery for the intervention. The coach also reveals himself to be an admirer of Daniel Goleman’s work on emotional intelligence and Terry Orlick’s volumes on psychology and leadership. He has also read recent books about Guardiola and Diego Simeone, while he still keeps tactical works on Mourinho from the Manchester United manager’s time in Portugal. Board uncertainty Following the long-awaited departure of Wenger, the new concern at Arsenal is the increasingly doubtful future of chief executive Ivan Gazidis. The CEO has an offer from AC Milan and informed the Arsenal board at the end of last month that he is considering a change. The suggestion in Italy is that Gazidis will link up with Milan at the end of the transfer window. It is peculiar timing. Gazidis won his long-running power battle with Wenger and has placed himself at the front and centre of this new Arsenal era. When Wenger departed, Gazidis attended the press conference in the immediate aftermath.  The executive then sat beside Emery, his choice as manager, at the Spaniard’s unveiling. Gazidis has shaped the club’s new structure, with Raul Sanllehi lured from Barcelona as head of football relations and Sven Mislintat brought in as head of recruitment from Borussia Dortmund. At the club’s London Colney base, Gazidis made a speech introducing the new manager and, on the tour of Singapore, Gazidis addressed staff, players and coaches at a club barbecue in a passionate defence of Ozil after the German retired from international football. He has spoken to Emery almost on a daily basis since the coach arrived and the Spaniard will now be keen to make a strong start in the Premier League if one of his strongest advocates is to depart so rapidly."
"It was the summer when the World Cup in Russia helped us fall in love with international football again but on Friday the Premier League is back to reclaim its place in our affections.  Here is a wishlist of 10 things to keep it at the top of the game. 1. Jose Mourinho was a great manager and he may be a great manager again but his relentless self-pity and his raging narcissism became tedious a long time ago. He was indulged, up to a point, when his teams were winning titles but his petulant behaviour on Manchester United’s tour of America this summer was almost as dull and predictable as some of the football he has been inflicting on United’s supporters over the past two seasons. I hope this is the season when United rid themselves of his yoke, preferably before players such as Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba move to escape him, and hire a boss who can treat Old Trafford to the kind of vibrant, attacking, energetic football that is in vogue elsewhere in the division. The World Cup reminded us that football is supposed to be fun but more than ever Mourinho seems intent on sucking the life out of the game. 2. In defiance of the prophecies that it would usher in anarchy at the World Cup, VAR was a success in Russia. The measured, intelligent way it was used proved that the Premier League was mistaken to bow to the hysteria that greeted its every implementation in the FA Cup last season by blocking its introduction in the league this season. So I hope that when the moaning begins this season about decisions that hard-pressed officials have got wrong, clubs remember the feeling of injustice long enough to make sure they do not delay any more and introduce the system ready for next season. The Premier League are supposed to be leaders in our game. Right now, the absence of VAR makes them look like troglodytes. 3. The reaction to Neymar’s pathetic histrionics for Brazil during the World Cup was another indication that the public have run out of patience with the antics of some players and the epidemic of attempted deception in the game. Sure, there are worse things in football: bad tackles that can end careers; swinging elbows that can shatter bones. But it is more and more obvious the efforts to feign or exaggerate injury are affecting the enjoyment of supporters. I hope this season that players who persevere with these antics are laughed out of town as Neymar has been. Maybe then, we will find a cure. 4. I am not a Liverpool supporter but I am a fan of much that the club stand for and of their manager, Jurgen Klopp, and everything he brings to the Premier League. He is part of the new wave of managers in our top flight whose intensity and zeal and love of the game trail enthusiasm and enjoyment behind them. Klopp has spent big in the transfer window and there is a consensus that he needs to win a trophy to justify the outlay. So I hope a Liverpool team that look like a side capable of fashioning a challenge for the title pick up a prize. The longer Klopp sticks around in England, the better. 5. There are too many vanilla palaces to excess in the Premier League; too many stadiums that have been turned into libraries; too many stadiums where the prawn sandwich brigade hold sway, where the idea of an intimidating atmosphere is but a distant memory. I hope the new Spurs stadium, scheduled to stage its first home league game in the middle of next month, is an antidote to all that. The stadium certainly looks the part. Its magnificent design is an indication that it might just be the kind of cauldron that will make it into one of the most stirring arenas in English game. 6. The criticism aimed at Paul Pogba last season because of the way he chose to have his hair cut was one of the more curious features of the Premier League campaign. It is time, surely, that we moved beyond appearance when trying to judge a footballer’s performance on the pitch. When I was at Edgbaston for the first Test on Friday, I consulted former England coach and renowned expert in modern manners, David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd, on this very matter but his belief that footballers should be restricted to short back and sides and only allowed tattoos that say ‘Mum and Dad’ or depict an anchor did not quite chime with my own. 7. Amid all the positivity that surrounded England at the World Cup, it was still obvious that Gareth Southgate’s side lacked a strong, creative influence in midfield; a player who can surge past a man; a player with the vision to thread a killer pass; a playmaker; a Christian Eriksen; an Eden Hazard; a Luka Modric. How encouraging it would be if we can start to remedy that this season by giving English players more game-time in our top league. In Russia, Southgate referenced the fact that only a third of players in the Premier League are English, thus reducing his talent pool drastically. If Jack Wilshere, at West Ham and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, at Chelsea, played more regularly this season, that would be a start.  If Phil Foden began to feature for Manchester City, that would be even better. The more eligible players who appear in our top division this season, the better Southgate’s chances of building on the successes of Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow and Samara. 8. The ugliest thing I saw last season was the harassment of referee Michael Oliver by then Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon in the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.  Different competition, sure, but the tendency of players and managers to blame officials for their own mistakes is still commonplace in the Premier League, too. This season, wouldn’t it be refreshing if players and bosses started to take responsibility for their own actions. If they don’t, it’s time to come down much harder on dissent. 9. Maybe it’s of limited interest to fans but it would be a step forward if the thaw in relations between the England team and the media that took place over the summer could be replicated in the Premier League. Yes, that makes journalists’ jobs easier and more pleasurable but the other lesson from what happened in Russia is that it helps to present players as three-dimensional beings rather than distant figures hidden behind the tinted windows of 4x4s. Southgate knows most players are ordinary, decent lads with inspiring stories to tell. It’s just that most of the time, they’re not allowed to talk. The more forward-thinking clubs grew more open some time ago but there are plenty still stuck in a dark age of suspicion and misinformation. 10. I enjoyed watching Manchester City last season as much as any title-winning team I have seen. But I hope the race for the title is closer this season because, for all City’s brilliance, it’s no fun when the title has effectively been won by Christmas. City are still the team to beat but Liverpool will press them more closely than United were able to last season. My prediction for the top four: 1. Manchester City 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Manchester United. One final wish for the new season: I hope my predictions get better, too."
