       "0  No wonder Jose Mourinho is worried about the start of the new season. Four days to go until it kicks off at Old Trafford and he is still waiting for the real Manchester United to turn up. This has been a strange, disjointed few weeks for Mourinho and his players, and it showed as they completed their pre-season on a muggy night in Munich. On this evidence, whatever team United put out on Friday night will struggle to overcome Leicester never mind challenge Manchester City's dominance of the Premier League.

       "2  The new Premier League season has finally arrived, and with it comes the hopes and expectations of many. Manchester City are hot favourites to continue their dominance under Pep Guardiola, while newcomers Wolves and Fulham have set down early markers with their aggressive approach to the transfer market. Sportsmail's resident expert PETER CROUCH gives his team-by-team guide for the campaign ahead.  How strange will it be in their first match against Manchester City when the camera switches to the dugout and Arsene Wenger is not there?  Wenger is all some people know of Arsenal and it is going to take everyone time to adjust. I do feel that change will be for the better, certainly in terms of the atmosphere at the Emirates. It had become toxic with so many wanting Wenger to go and it affected the players.  During Stoke’s game in April it felt like the home crowd were desperate to turn on him. It will be fascinating to see how Unai Emery gets on. He has been linked with jobs here bef...   \n",
       "3  Manchester United have held talks with Bayern Munich over a proposed deal for Jerome Boateng. Sportsmail reported last week that the 29-year-old had been offered to United after his move to Paris Saint-Germain fell through. Bayern are prepared to accept around £45million for former Manchester City defender Boateng, who turns 30 next month, but United want to drive the price lower. A new centre-half remains the priority and Mourinho is banking on United chief Ed Woodward delivering one. Boateng — a half-time substitute for Bayern on Sunday night — has emerged as a serious alternative to Harry Maguire who is being priced out of a move by Leicester. Talks are understood to have taken place between United and their German hosts on Sunday night over Boateng. United would want to reduce that fee of £45m to nearer £40m. Asked about Boateng, Mourinho emphasised the need for United chief Ed Woodward to make a new signing. 'The other clubs that compete with us are really strong or they have ...   \n",
       "4  Everton have agreed a £28.5million fee for Barcelona defender Yerry Mina after his talks withManchester United stalled. Mina had been heavily linked with a switch to United, who are eager to bring in another centre-back. However, the Colombia international is instead edging towards joining Everton, where he would become the fourth arrival at Goodison Park in this transfer window following the signings of Richarlison, Joao Virginia and Mina's former Barcelona team-mate Lucas Digne. Mina only joined Barcelona in January, but was restricted to just six appearances to the club, although he did win the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey. The 23-year-old impressed for Colombia at the World Cup and could be a hugely important player for Marco Silva's side this campaign.  Everton get their Premier League season underway on Saturday when they travel to face newly-promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Following that the Toffees, who finished eighth last season, will host Southampton.  Richarlis...   \n",

       "\"No wonder Jose Mourinho is worried about the start of the new season. Four days to go until it kicks off at Old Trafford and he is still waiting for the real Manchester United to turn up. This has been a strange, disjointed few weeks for Mourinho and his players, and it showed as they completed their pre-season on a muggy night in Munich. On this evidence, whatever team United put out on Friday night will struggle to overcome Leicester never mind challenge Manchester City's dominance of the Premier League. BAYERN MUNICH (3-4-3): Neuer; Kimmich (Rudy 72), Sule, Hummels (Boateng 46), Alaba (Bernat 56); Martinez; Robben, Muller, Thiago (Rafinha 60), Ribery; Gnabry. Subs: Ulreich, Hoffmann, Lewandowski, Boateng, Goretzka, Coman, Mai, Zylla, Franzke. Booked: Boateng Scorer: Martinez 59 MAN UTD (4-3-3): De Gea (Grant 78); Darmian (Jones 65), Bailly (Smalling 51), Lindelof (Tuanzebe 78), Shaw (Mitchell 78); Herrera (Garner 81), Pereira, Fred (Chong 78); Mata (McTominay 65), Rashford (Fosu-Mensah 65), Sanchez.\\xa0 Subs: Greenwood. Referee: Robert Hartmann After City gave another demonstration of what they can do at Wembley, United looked every bit a team that is coming together in drips and drabs. Marcus Rashford returned for more than an hour here, officially inheriting the No.10 shirt vacated by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while Phil Jones and Victor Lindelof also played for the first time since the World Cup. But there was still no Paul Pogba, no Romelu Lukaku, no Jesse Lingard, no Ashley Young and no Marouane Fellaini. Nemanja Matic and Antonio Valencia are injured. Anthony Martial and Marcos Rojo were left at home when United flew to Germany, casting further doubt over their futures at Old Trafford, and Eric Bailly limped off early in the second half. A new centre-half remains the priority and Mourinho is banking on United chief Ed Woodward delivering one. United were reported to have stepped up their interest in Harry Maguire with a £75million bid on Sunday night as Leicester continue to resist. It's understood that Jerome Boateng – a half-time substitute for Bayern here – is emerging as another strong possibility even though he would cost £50m and turns 30 next month. Asked about Boateng, Mourinho said: 'My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens.' Otherwise, the United boss is preparing to make the most out of the players he has available against Leicester. 'We were unlucky to get the Friday game so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is not enough,' he added. 'We have to organise the week in a way that we can arrive fresh for Friday because Friday starts the Premier League and we play for points and Friday is the players we have. 'There is no time to cry for the players that are not going to be. On Friday we go with the best possible team.' United look anything but the finished article and it's hard to see how they can click into gear in four days after such a fragmented preparation. They were under the cosh throughout here and David de Gea made first half saves from Thiago Alcantara and Serge Gnabry. However, he was beaten in the 59th minute when Javi Martinez rose to score with a glancing header from Thiago's corner, a timely reminder perhaps of United's need for an upgrade in central defence. Manuel Neuer did not have a single save to make and Mourinho ended the game by sending on the kids and third-choice keeper Lee Grant. Maybe it was a message to Woodward. Their strained relationship could deteriorate even further if there isn't a new addition through the door by 5pm on Thursday. Peter Kenyon, the former United and Chelsea chief executive who played a key role in Mourinho's appointment at Stamford Bridge in 2004, has been there before and claimed on Sunday that the 55-year-old Portuguese coach can still make it work. But he warned: 'United is bigger than anybody, bigger than any individual and that's always been the mantra.'\\xa0\""
