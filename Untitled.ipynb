       "'First major deal completed by government since collapse of Carillion condemned by unions  Angela Monaghan   Tue 19 Jun 2018 20.24\\xa0BST   Last modified on Wed 20 Jun 2018 00.05\\xa0BST   Capita has been awarded a new contract from the Ministry of Defence to run UK military fire and rescue services despite a financial health assessment that attached the highest possible risk rating to the outsourcing company. The awarding of the contract was condemned by unions. It is the first major deal completed by the government since the collapse of the rival firm Carillion in January, which put the outsourcing of the public sector under the spotlight.  Capita scored 10 out of 10 for risk in a document prepared for the MoD. One indicates the lowest probability of distress and 10 the highest. The risk assessment document was updated on 7 June, according to the Financial Times. On Tuesday Capita confirmed it had been selected for the contract, which is estimated to be worth about £500m over 10 years and involves the running of about 70 military fire stations worldwide. Shares in the company, which also announced it had sold its supply chain business Supplier Assessment Services, raising £160m, according to analysts, closed up nearly 8% at 164p, before the FT first reported the 10/10 risk assessment score. As part of the risk assessment Capita was also awarded a “health score” of just three out of 100. A score of 25 or less is deemed to be in a red “warning area” of heightened vulnerability. Capita beat Serco to the MoD deal, with the FT reporting that the rival bidder was judged an eight out of 10 risk. The MoD said Capita’s bid was considered to be the best technical solution and the best value for money for defence. A spokesperson said: “All our suppliers are subject to robust assessments ahead of any contract placement and closely monitored throughout.  “This document provides background information, using a range of statistics and figures from external sources. The ratings in question are from [financial consultants] Company Watch, not the MoD.” Unite condemned the decision to award the contract to Capita. Jim Kennedy, the union’s national officer for MoD workers, said: “It is absolutely scandalous that even though the MoD’s own financial check found that awarding a contract to Capita was extremely risky, ministers thought it appropriate to award this contract. “The government has clearly learnt nothing from the Carillion fiasco. There needs to be an urgent investigation into how and why this contract was let to Capita.”  Capita came under the spotlight just days after the extent of Carillion’s woes came to light, when the new chief executive, Jon Lewis, announced a plans to tap the market for £700m of investment and suspended a dividend that was worth more than £200m to shareholders last year.'"
