       "'First major deal completed by government since collapse of Carillion condemned by unions  Angela Monaghan   Tue 19 Jun 2018 20.24\\xa0BST   Last modified on Wed 20 Jun 2018 00.05\\xa0BST   Capita has been awarded a new contract from the Ministry of Defence to run UK military fire and rescue services despite a financial health assessment that attached the highest possible risk rating to the outsourcing company. The awarding of the contract was condemned by unions. It is the first major deal completed by the government since the collapse of the rival firm Carillion in January, which put the outsourcing of the public sector under the spotlight.  Capita scored 10 out of 10 for risk in a document prepared for the MoD. One indicates the lowest probability of distress and 10 the highest. The risk assessment document was updated on 7 June, according to the Financial Times. On Tuesday Capita confirmed it had been selected for the contract, which is estimated to be worth about £500m over 10 years and involves the running of about 70 military fire stations worldwide. Shares in the company, which also announced it had sold its supply chain business Supplier Assessment Services, raising £160m, according to analysts, closed up nearly 8% at 164p, before the FT first reported the 10/10 risk assessment score. As part of the risk assessment Capita was also awarded a “health score” of just three out of 100. A score of 25 or less is deemed to be in a red “warning area” of heightened vulnerability. Capita beat Serco to the MoD deal, with the FT reporting that the rival bidder was judged an eight out of 10 risk. The MoD said Capita’s bid was considered to be the best technical solution and the best value for money for defence. A spokesperson said: “All our suppliers are subject to robust assessments ahead of any contract placement and closely monitored throughout.  “This document provides background information, using a range of statistics and figures from external sources. The ratings in question are from [financial consultants] Company Watch, not the MoD.” Unite condemned the decision to award the contract to Capita. Jim Kennedy, the union’s national officer for MoD workers, said: “It is absolutely scandalous that even though the MoD’s own financial check found that awarding a contract to Capita was extremely risky, ministers thought it appropriate to award this contract. “The government has clearly learnt nothing from the Carillion fiasco. There needs to be an urgent investigation into how and why this contract was let to Capita.”  Capita came under the spotlight just days after the extent of Carillion’s woes came to light, when the new chief executive, Jon Lewis, announced a plans to tap the market for £700m of investment and suspended a dividend that was worth more than £200m to shareholders last year.'"

A 1998 court ruling  blocked video games from using Nazi symbols, with judges fearing at the time that children 'will grow up with these symbols and insignia and grow accustomed to them'.

       "75   A prehistoric 13-year-old girl who lived 50,000 years ago was the love child of two separate species of ancient human ancestor, according to a new DNA analysis of her remains. A study of a tiny bone fragment found in a cave in Russia shows the teenager had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father, giving fresh insight into how the now-extinct species interacted. The find suggests that our ape-like cousins mated far more frequently than researchers thought, according to archaeologists. Neanderthals and Denisovans share a common ancestor with humans, and roamed Eurasia as far back as 400,000 years ago having migrated from Africa. The pair of human-like species then intermingled with modern humans when they arrived on the continent around 40,000 years ago, with members of the three species sometimes cross-breeding. This means that tiny amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA can still be found in our genome today, with a study last year discovering that as much as 2 per cent of ou...   \n",

Does this mean it is not a penalty? No, there is a difference between getting a touch and dispossessing a player. Schar uses a scissor motion to make the tackle and it is his second leg which is guilty of the foul, and it is a foul. So yes, I support the decision of Paul Tierney, although I understand why it will split opinion. This is one of those where even the use of VAR would not be definitive and would still lead to debate. As for Newcastle's goal, it should not have stood. DeAndre Yedlin clearly uses his arm in the face of Olivier Giroud and, for me, did so deliberately.

       "163  A self-declared 'cyborg' has injected microchips into his hands and wrists that act as the keys to his front door, motorcycle and even drawers in his home. Canadian Russ Foxx, 36, has had over 100 body alterations ranging from ultraviolet tattoos to silicon horns implanted into his forehead. The body modification artist recently showcased some of the many uses for the chips that lie under his skin - including the ability to unlock a hand-made wooden concealment table 'hands free'. While the modifications are extreme, Mr Foxx says 'anyone who carries keys' could benefit from the chip implants - which are no larger than a grain of rice.

We’re in our mid-50s and it’s a second marriage for both of us. I was over the moon when he asked. But, since then, he has seemed reluctant to set a date. Every time I bring up wedding stuff, he says that there’s no rush and changes the subject. I’d managed to convince myself not to worry but, last month, a friend announced that she, too, was engaged — and they’re having a New Year wedding. Now everyone keeps asking me when mine is. The whole thing is just making my insecurities worse. Why is he taking so long to set a date?

When Manchester United fans attempt a similar stunt ahead of the game against Burnley next Sunday, the club's manager, Jose Mourinho, will not be the headline act. Wenger never complained about the money he was given to spend but Mourinho is not like that and so it is Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, who will take the flak, even though he has given him hundreds of millions of pounds for new arrivals.

As a result, Mars will appear almost three times larger than normal in the night sky.

       "225  Just so you know,' says Ben Curry, 'Tom is not actually my landlord.'  The joke at Sale is how Tom used his England match fees to buy their Cheshire home, before taking in his uncapped twin brother as a rent-paying lodger. 'It's funny but it's not actually true,' chuckles Ben. 'We heard a new one this week: 'What do you call a curry in the England canteen? … Tom'.' A dose of humour can go a long way during pre-season — especially at the end of a week when the club's star signing, Chris Ashton, has been hit with a seven-week ban for a red card against Castres. 'Chris hardly touched the guy,' says Ben, who was one of the closest witnesses to Ashton's tip tackle. 'I was literally right there and the guy just threw himself. He jumped. It was a weird game.' Teasing his identical twin, Tom adds: 'I had to come in and protect you at one point. You were in a bit of trouble!' Sale reluctantly accepted the punishment and now the Currys will help lead their dark-horse charge for a top-four fi...   \n",
       "227  Ian Poulter and Paul Casey will both need wildcards if they are to play for Europe in the Ryder Cup in Paris next month.  Their final chance to make the team by right came and went when both finished down the field in the first of the FedEx Cup play-off events on the PGA Tour. Both needed a minimum of a top-20 finish in the Northern Trust to displace Thorbjorn Olesen in the last automatic spot, but neither came close after final rounds of 69 for Poulter and 74 for Casey. In theory, they could make a late dash and play in the Made in Denmark tournament this week, which is the final qualifying event. In reality, both will be in Boston for the second FedEx play-off tournament, which does not count. That event, however, will be completed before captain Thomas Bjorn names his four wildcards on September 5, so Poulter and Casey will have one final chance to impress, as will two more on the outside looking in — Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Swede Henrik Stenson. In truth, it is hard to ...   \n",
       "81   Sections of Arctic soil are no longer freezing over all year round, threatening to pump thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Scientists found that soil in one of the world's coldest regions remained mushy and damp throughout the most recent winter. During these months the soil normally freezes over, forming a protective layer over Arctic permafrost that houses billions of tonnes of ancient carbon. Scientists warned that without this insulation, the permafrost will begin to melt, potentially releasing a dangerous payload of carbon dioxide and methane. Scroll down for video  Russian scientist Dr Nikita Zimov sent a team to drill into the top layer of soil at Cherskiy, Russia, in April. The small town in Northern Siberia is one of the coldest places on Earth, with average winter temperatures as low as -34°C (-29°F). His team found that the top layer of soil at Cherskiy - one of the coldest places on Earth - failed to freeze over during winter, instead remaining...   \n",
       "153  They are the bricks that could build mankind's first home on another planet. European Space Agency officials have revealed the latest 'moon bricks' that could soon be used to construct a lunar habitat. They say the bricks are the starting point to building up a permanent lunar outpost and breaking explorers' reliance on Earth supplies. Scroll down for video  The surface of the Moon is covered in grey, fine, rough dust.  Lunar soil is a basaltic material made up of silicates, a common feature in planetary bodies with volcanism. ESA has been experimenting using a similar material on Earth. The material is first compacted into shape, then heated using a furnace to 'bake' the brick.   The resulting bricks have the equivalent strength of gypsum, and are set to undergo detailed mechanical testing. ESA said.  'Moon bricks will be made of dust,' says Aidan Cowley, ESA's science advisor with a wealth of experience in dealing with lunar soil.  'You can create solid blocks out of it to build ...   \n",
       "39   Humans aren’t the only ones that blush when they get excited. Scientists have discovered that blue-and-yellow macaws ruffle their head feathers and even turn pink in the face in certain social situations. While it’s still a mystery what exactly they’re trying to communicate with these gestures, the experts suspect it’s a sign of positive interaction. Scroll down for video  The blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) is a type of parrot known for their intelligence and verbal skills. In a new study, researchers observed five hand-reared captive macaws as they interacted with each other and with their human caretakers. The team focused on the birds’ feather position (ruffled or sleeked) on the crown, nape, and cheek. They also looked for signs of blushing on their cheeks, where the skin is bare. During the interactions, the researchers noticed several differences in their visual cues. Feather ruffling, for example, was more common when the birds were not in motion. This could be seen du...   \n",
