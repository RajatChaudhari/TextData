"Paul Pogba's agent is trying to engineer a sensational deal for the Manchester United star to leave Old Trafford for Barcelona. Mino Raiola has been in detailed discussions with the Spanish club over signing the midfielder, two years after he rejoined United from Juventus for £89million. Pogba returned for pre-season training on Monday after winning the World Cup with France, and sources close to him say he would be open to a move.  United insisted on Monday night that Pogba is not for sale and they are believed to have rejected an opening offer from Barcelona of £44.6million plus two players — Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes. It seems inconceivable that United would let go of their record signing, and Pogba's camp accept it will be difficult to complete a deal before the transfer window closes. However, the fact that Raiola is touting Pogba to Barcelona — apparently with his client's blessing — is a worrying development for United after a difficult pre-season, and comes so close to United's Premier League opener at home to Leicester on Friday. United are aware that it could be a ploy by Pogba's representative to secure him a new contract on the same terms as £500,000-a-week top earner Alexis Sanchez. Raiola is known to have approached United about a raise for Pogba after Sanchez moved to Old Trafford from Arsenal in January. But this isn't the first time the 25-year-old's future at Old Trafford has been in doubt. Raiola, who took a staggering £41m cut of Pogba's then world record fee when he returned to Old Trafford from Italy in 2016, sounded out some of Europe's top clubs in January and Pep Guardiola confirmed that the player had been offered to Manchester City. As Pogba's relationship with Jose Mourinho grew increasingly strained last season, Sportsmail revealed in April that the United manager was prepared to sell him this summer.  The situation has not been helped by Mourinho's negative comments about Pogba's success with France at the World Cup, made on several occasions during United's recent tour of the US, that went down very badly with the player. Instead of praising Pogba's performances, Mourinho urged him to 'understand' why he had done so well in Russia and appeared to suggest the player lacked the same focus for his club. There have been concerns for some time that Pogba has been distracted by his commitments off the pitch and a growing entourage. 'I don't think it's about us getting the best out of him, it's about him giving the best he has to give,' said Mourinho last month. 'I think the World Cup is the perfect habitat for a player like him to give the best. Why? Because it's closed for a month, where he can only think about football. 'The players are in a closed camp, isolated from the external world, from commercial compromises, and every possible influence.' Reports that Raiola had spoken with Barcelona and was set for talks with United over Pogba's future began to circulate in Spain and Italy on Monday. Sources close to the player confirmed they were accurate, but the chances of United allowing him to leave Old Trafford two years into a five-year deal always seemed unlikely. In theory, Barcelona would have until the end of the month to sign Pogba before the transfer window closes in Spain. However, the deadline in England is 5pm on Thursday, leaving United little or no time to sign a replacement unless they intended to replace him with new £52m signing Fred. Pogba's midfield partner Nemanja Matic is also sidelined following abdominal surgery in America. Meanwhile, United remain in talks with Bayern Munich over Germany centre back Jerome Boateng. Bayern want £50m for the former Manchester City defender, but United are unwilling to pay more than £40m for a player who turns 30 next month. Mina, Leicester's Harry Maguire and Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld have been the alternative targets as Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward looks to deliver the new centre back that Mourinho wants. The deal could hinge on Marcos Rojo leaving United and he has yet to be convinced that a move to Everton is the best option for him. Everton have lined up Mina as a back-up if they cannot sign Rojo but face competition from Lyon."
"Stan Kroenke has made a cash offer to buy Arsenal in a deal that values the club at £1.8billion. The American billionaire, who already owns 67 per cent of the Premier League club through Kroenke Sports Enterprise (KSE) UK, wants to buy the remainder of the shares after securing the backing of minority owner Alisher Usmanov. Kroenke said in a statement to the London stock exchange that he believed the club would benefit from being taken private, with his son Josh set to take on a more hands on role. Kroenke Jr could even emerge as a candidate to replace chief executive Ivan Gazidis if he decides to take up an offer from AC Milan.  Usmanov, who has tried to buy out Kroenke's majority stake in the past, will receive £550million for his 30 per cent stake based on the share price of £29,419.64.   The Kroenke statement said: 'We at KSE are moving forward with this Offer leading to 100% ownership of the Club. We appreciate Mr Usmanov's dedication to the Arsenal Football Club and the storied ethos and history the Club represents. 'The successful implementation of the Offer will result in the opening of a new chapter in the history of the Club in bringing 100 per cent private ownership by KSE.  'KSE believes moving to private ownership will bring the benefits of a single owner better able to move quickly in furtherance of the Club's strategy and ambitions. KSE is a committed, long-term owner of the Club.'  The statement adds that Deutsche Bank has agreed to provide Kroenke with a bridging loan of £557m to complete the buy-out. In order to secure the loan, Kroenke paid the bank a fee of £5.57m last week.  But they insist: 'The offer is not being funded by way of any debt finance... for which the payment of interest on, repayment of, or security for any liability... will depend on the business of Arsenal.'   The move comes at a crucial time for the club after Arsene Wenger stepped down as manager after 22 years to be replaced by Unai Emery.  Arsenal begin their Premier League campaign against defending champions Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium this Sunday. The Premier League transfer window closes on Thursday afternoon and signings cannot be made after that point.   Usmanov, who doesn't have a seat on the club's board despite being the second biggest shareholder, made a £1bn offer to buy out Kroenke in May last year but was rejected.   KSE (wholly owned by Stan Kroenke) - 41,743 shares (67.09 per cent) Red and White Securities (Usmanov) - 18,695 shares (30.04 per cent)  Independent shareholders - 1,781 (2.87 per cent) TOTAL SHARES - 62,219  Back in October, KSE offered around £525m to buy out Usmanov's stake but this was turned down. KSE, the corporation owned by Kroenke, currently holds 41,743 shares in Arsenal equating to 67.09 per cent control. They have 'received an irrevocable undertaking' from Usmanov's company, Red and White Securities, to buy their entire holding of 18,695 shares, or 30.05 per cent. The offer is expected to be accepted by 3pm on Tuesday afternoon.  Usmanov's holding equated to around 90 per cent of the shares Kroenke didn't already own and he will now buy out the remaining independent shareholders.  KSE also own the Denver Nuggets basketball team and the Los Angeles Rams American Football team in the US.   The Arsenal Supporters Trust registered their disgust at the news, saying Kroenke's takeover represents 'a dreadful day' for the club. A statement read: 'This news marks a dreadful day for Arsenal Football Club. 'Stan Kroenke taking the Club private will see the end of supporters owning shares in Arsenal and their role upholding custodianship values. 'By taking the Club private Stan Kroenke will be able to implement the following detrimental actions: 'The AST is also extremely concerned to note that this purchase is being funded by a loan. 'The most dreadful part of this announcement is the news that Kroenke plans to forcibly purchase the shares held by Arsenal fans. Many of these fans are AST members and hold their shares not for value but as custodians who care for the future of the club. 'Kroenke's actions will neuter their voice and involvement. It is in effect legalised theft to remove shareholder scrutiny on how Arsenal is managed. 'The AST is wholly against this takeover. Arsenal remains too important to be owned by any one person.'  The news of Kroenke taking full control didn't go down well with Arsenal legend Ian Wright, who tweeted: 'Oh God Noooooooooooooooo.'  Arsenal fans, many of whom have been critical of Kroenke and his lack of investment in players and lack of communication in the past, reacted with dismay on social media.  Tim Payton wrote: 'Disastrous news for Arsenal. Looking set to be wholly owned by American investor. Will transfer business to the US. No accountability, no transparency, finances hidden. Supporter shareholders forced out. Custodianship dead.'  Twitter user Highbury Harold wrote: 'Shame on those who refused to protest against Kroenke. Shame on those who actually defended his actions. And shame on ALL of those who sold shares to him; you know who you are, and you're complicit in all of this.'  User MrDtAFC wrote: 'Kroenke taking full control of the club will destroy us, thanks David Dein for introducing him to the club, thanks Lady Bracewell-Smith for selling him your shares, and thank Wenger for being his puppet and letting him mug us off for years. How the f**k do we get him out now.'  Adam Keys tweeted: 'If Stan Kroenke buys 100% of Arsenal, he can take the company completely private. When that happens, he won't have to publicly declare the club's finances. He would effectively run it like Newcastle and Sunderland - 'where has all the money gone?!'   Real estate and sports mogul Stan Kroenke, 71, has built a fortune valued at some $8.3billion (£6.4m) by Forbes. The American's takeover of Arsenal will only bolster a large sports portfolio that includes stakes in the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the Los Angeles Rams NFL franchise, the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team and Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer. He first became a shareholder in Arsenal in May 2007, was appointed to the board of directors in September 2008 and became the club's majority shareholder in April 2011. Outside of sport, Kroenke, who is married to the Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, owns some 30 million square feet of real estate and two million acres of ranches across the United States and Canada.   "
"It's approaching the realm of panic stations for English clubs as they look to do some last-minute business before the transfer window shuts. There could be some high-profile comings and goings in the Premier League with just three days until the deadline. Sportsmail's ROBERT COTTINGHAM is here to take you through all the done deals and rumours as we get them throughout the day.  If you are reading this blog on the MailOnline app, click HERE for full coverage.  The former England No 1 will sign a two-year contract with Sean Dyche's side, with the option of an extra season. Burnley, who already have Tom Heaton and Nick Pope on their books, will pay in the region of £3.5million for Hart.  READ THE FULL STORY HERE The London club have had a £9million bid to sign the Belgian World Cup star rejected, but are prepared to increase it to £12m as they prepare for life back in the English Premier League. Celtic have said he is not for sale but Boyata is keen on the move.  READ THE FULL STORY HERE Jose Mourinho has made it clear to the Old Trafford hierarchy that a new central defender is a priority but United appear no closer to landing any of their targets. According to the Daily Mirror, they will offer Tottenham £40m for the Belgian in a take it or leave it offer that still falls some way short of the London club's valuation of £55m. The deal will be announced on Tuesday, subject to a work permit, with Bernard due for a medical on Merseyside. The free transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk is seen as a coup for Goodison Park manager Marco Silva, whose personal intervention swung the deal Everton's way. READ THE FULL STORY HERE Mauricio Pochettino is desperate to get some new faces in before Thursday evening's deadline, but it looks like there will be another exit before any arrivals. According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Roma had hoped to sign Steven N'Zonzi over the summer but they have so far been unsuccessful. READ THE FULL STORY HERE BEN NAGLE: Chelsea are 'set to pay Jan Oblak's £89million release clause' in order to replace Thibaut Courtois before the start of the season. Courtois failed to turn up for training on Monday and has told the club he wants to move to Real Madrid, leaving Chelsea with little time to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts on Thursday evening. According to a report in Mundo Deportivo though, the Blues are set to raid Courtois' former club Atletico Madrid for their star man Jan Oblak."
"Chelsea are 'set to pay Jan Oblak's £89million release clause' in order to replace Thibaut Courtois before the start of the season. Courtois failed to turn up for training on Monday and has told the club he wants to move to Real Madrid, leaving Chelsea with little time to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts on Thursday evening. According to a report in Mundo Deportivo though, the Blues are set to raid Courtois' former club Atletico Madrid for their star man Jan Oblak. The Slovenian stopper has an £89m release clause, but the Spanish paper writes that Chelsea will pay that in the next 24 hours as they look to push through the move. It is understood that the Stamford Bridge outfit have turned to Oblak after moves for Alisson, Pepe Reina and Jordan Pickford fell through this summer. Their three 'more affordable' options fell through after Alisson chose instead to move to Liverpool, while Reina opted to remain loyal to AC Milan, who have just paid £9m to sign him.  Everton, meanwhile, asked for £58m for Pickford, but Chelsea have now opted to spend more to ensure the arrival of one of the world's best goalkeepers. Oblak's potential arrival in west London would likely ensure Courtois gets his way and secures a return to the Spanish capital, where his family live. He spent three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid after joining Chelsea back in 2011, impressing as the club won La Liga and the Europa League, before finishing runners up in the Champions League in 2014. "
"Manchester United are ready to 'enter the race to sign Ousmane Dembele' before the Thursday's transfer deadline as boss Jose Mourinho demands new faces ahead of the campaign.  The club have added Lee Grant, Diogo Dalot and Fred already this summer but a central defender and another flair player are high on Mourinho's wishlist.  According to Mundo Deportivo, Mourinho has eyed Dembele, who also fuelled talk of a move to Arsenal having posed with the club's big stars recently, having seen his relationship with Anthony Martial sour.   Appearances: 33  Minutes: 1097  Goals: 5  Assists: 6  The 21-year-old has struggled badly with injuries since leaving Borussia Dortmund for Barcelona and after the arrival of Malcom this summer, he may angle for a new start in England. Mourinho has long said he wishes for two more players before the season with stars such as Harry Maguire, Toby Alderweireld and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic all linked to an Old Trafford switch. But with little movement during the club's disappointing pre-season tour of America, the Portuguese's relationship with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is said to have become strained. An awkward exchange in the tunnel after the friendly against Real Madrid demonstrated in public for the first time how tense the pair's relationship was and no new arrivals will only likely exacerbate it from Mourinho's side.   'My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens,' Mourinho said on Sunday.  'If we don't make our team better it will be a difficult season for us.' Prior to that, Mourinho's extraordinary outburst in Michigan where he questioned a number of players and exposed his undeniable anguish at the lack of new faces has cranked up the pressure with two days to go.  United host Leicester City in the opening game of the new Premier League season on Friday night but new faces remains up in the air with Jerome Boateng also on the radar following defeat to Bayern Munich."
"Tottenham are set to let Victor Wanyama leave to join Serie A side Roma - despite failing to secure any new signings in the transfer window yet. Mauricio Pochettino is desperate to get some new faces in before Thursday evening's deadline, but it looks like there will be another exit before any arrivals. According to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Roma had hoped to sign Steven N'Zonzi over the summer but they have so far been unsuccessful. Games played:  23  Mins: 839  Goals scored: 1 Assists: 0  Pass Success: 87.2%  They are now reportedly turning their attentions to Wanyama, who only started eight Premier League games for Pochettino's Spurs last season. N'Zonzi, meanwhile, could yet leave Sevilla but he is understood to be keen on a return to the Premier League over a move to Italy. Arsenal and Everton have both been linked with the former Stoke City man, but time is running out before the window shuts for English teams on Thursday. Wanyama is not a regular starter for Tottenham, despite making 23 competitive appearances last season. He came on as a substitute in 11 of those, only starting eight league games and four FA Cup ties. The Kenyan is also currently sidelined with a knee injury, and he missed four months of last season through various ailments. He first injured his knee last August, before a thigh problem in May and another knee issue last month. "
"When Harry Kane dropped in on Mauricio Pochettino’s office at Tottenham’s training ground after the World Cup his manager was ready to congratulate him. The England striker, who scored a tournament-best six goals during a faith-restoring run to the semi-finals, was having none of it. ‘No gaffer,’ he said. ‘I am really disappointed — I should have scored more goals.’ Recalling a slightly surreal five hours in Enfield, Pochettino — speaking in Minneapolis at the end of Spurs’ US tour — says he moved quickly to console the 25-year-old. ‘I told him, “You won the Golden Boot!” But he said scoring six goals and reaching the semi-finals was not enough.’ Kane would not have been fishing for compliments, but what he was saying was music to the Argentine’s ears. ‘That is why I love him,’ Pochettino adds of his star, who returned to training on Monday ahead of Saturday’s opener at Newcastle. ‘I love his energy and desire. For him it is not enough to finish fourth in the World Cup or second or third in the Premier League.’ Pochettino invests huge amounts of time in his charges, building them not only as players but as people. A family man, he has a strong moral compass. Kane did not have to visit his manager so soon after the World Cup but he did the right thing. ‘I love it when a player thinks like this and wants to come in and spend time with us after playing for so long in the World Cup,’ Pochettino says. ‘It is so Harry.’ Like player, like manager. Kane’s attitude to winning the Golden Boot mirrors that of his workaholic boss. There can be a misconception about Pochettino. That qualifying for the Champions League, which he has now achieved three seasons in a row, is viewed as success. Critics will point out that he is yet to win a trophy. Those achievements came on the back of a four-year net spend of around £50million. In the same period, the figure for both Manchester clubs is more than 10 times that amount. And yet the top four is not enough. ‘If some people believe the manager of Tottenham doesn’t want to win they are not right in their minds,’ Pochettino says. ‘I’m here to win. The reality is to win and to have the argument about whether you have the tools to win is a different matter. We have had massive success at the club, getting Champions League for a third year in a row. ‘But maybe that is not enough and maybe we need to change certain things because for me it is not enough. I want to challenge and fight to win things until the end, that moment when my chairman Daniel Levy says to me, “Mauricio go home and find another project”.’  This feels like a message to the chairman, who has done well to tie down the club’s top names, including Kane, to new contracts but who has so far failed to add to last season’s squad. Some believe that the pending move to the new £850m stadium has had an impact. Club officials dispute this but Pochettino acknowledges his employers do things differently. ‘Winning is my concern and I feel responsible for this after four years with the club to try to achieve this,’ he says. ‘Maybe our history and the reality is different, but the players are fighting and working so hard and we are there with them. To compete at that level and challenge the big sides that have focused on improving their teams, while the reality for us has been improving our facilities, such as building the training ground and new stadium, I think it is not fair to compare us with these kind of clubs.’ He is right. But this is the unforgiving Premier League and people will make those comparisons, not least Tottenham’s own supporters. ‘We are competing in the same race but in a different way,’ Pochettino admits. He is a resourceful soul because he has had to be. Espanyol, Southampton and Spurs are not known for hurling cash at problems. While much can and maybe will happen between now and Thursday’s closing of the transfer window, Pochettino is ready to get creative again. ‘In football all can happen,’ he says. ‘We have come close but our opponents are at a level where every year they improve. We will keep pushing with different energy and different tools.’ One of those tools will be the club’s youngsters. The tour of the US was tough. An unfortunate run of injuries has been exacerbated by issues with Vincent Wanyama, Erik Lamela and Moussa Sissoko. The lack of World Cup stars present also led to the use of Luke Amos (21), George Marsh (19) and Oliver Skipp (17), all of whom have impressed. Pochettino has been delighted with what he has seen in wins over Roma and AC Milan and a penalty defeat by Barcelona. ‘I feel so happy,’ he says. ‘The future of the club is bright with the young players we have. ‘Without the World Cup players in the team, for them to keep going in that way shows this is not the point to be worried because I think we are going to improve the team. It meant we were able to give game-time to the young ones and that experience you cannot gain in one year training with the first team — three games in 10 days and that level of competition.’ While he would hate to admit it, if he does end up having to use those youngsters and grabs another top-four spot, this could be his greatest achievement yet."
"Rio Ferdinand has warned Manchester United not to sell record signing Paul Pogba to Barcelona before the transfer window shuts. As revealed by Sportsmail, agent Mino Raiola is trying to engineer a sensational deal for the Frenchman to leave Old Trafford in the coming days. Sources close to Pogba indicate he would be open to a move, but club legend Rio Ferdinand has urged executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to keep him.  Premier League apps: 25 (2) Premier League goals: 6 Premier League assists: 10  Pass success: 65.3% Manager Jose Mourinho has already predicted a 'difficult season' if United do not do more business, so losing a World Cup-winning midfielder would only add to that. As a result, Ferdinand - who made over 450 appearance for United - wants Pogba to stay and Spurs defender Toby Alderweireld to come in. Responding to a Sportsmail tweet, Ferdinand said: 'Don't you dare allow this ED... #MUFC is Pogba's home!! Silence these rumours ASAP & get @AlderweireldTob through the door.' United start their Premier League campaign on Friday against Leicester and, speaking on Sunday, Mourinho told MUTV: 'My CEO knows what I want and I still have a few days to wait and see what happens. 'The other clubs who compete with us are really strong and already have fantastic teams. Or they are investing massively like Liverpool, who are buying everything and everybody.'"
"I’ve been impressed so far with almost everything Ed Smith has done in his first couple of months as England’s national selector. I’ve worked with selectors in the past who seem more concerned with saving their jobs than actually doing them. But, from what I can see, Smith is making brave decisions for the benefit of the England team, not for the benefit of himself. Look at the choices he’s made. He brought Jos Buttler back into Test cricket on the evidence of his form at the IPL, even though plenty of people were saying he needed more red-ball runs under his belt. He pushed for Sam Curran, who helped turn around England’s fortunes in that thrilling first Test against India at Edgbaston. He went for Adil Rashid, despite a torrent of criticism. And he’s been pretty ruthless about dropping guys he doesn’t think fit the bill — the likes of Mark Stoneman, James Vince and Dawid Malan. Now he’s plumped for Ollie Pope, a 20-year-old who a year ago had barely played a handful of games for Surrey. He’s got good, logical reasons for everything he’s done and he should be applauded for it. I didn’t agree with the precedent set by the selection of Rashid, because of his refusal to play red-ball cricket for Yorkshire at the time. But that doesn’t mean I take issue with his selection on purely cricketing terms. The two are separate issues. Smith is clearly interested in picking players for different conditions and the key will be how consistent he is with that. If, for example, England’s next Test was in Brisbane, would he turn round to Curran and say, sorry, your game isn’t suited to Australian conditions and the Kookaburra? Those sort of moments will be the acid test. On the other hand, I like the fact that this is how he’s thinking. Perhaps if he’d been in place before the last Ashes, Moeen Ali would have been spared his ordeal. He was probably the player of the summer in England in 2017, but it always looked likely he was going to struggle Down Under — where they eat off-spinners for breakfast. Yet no one on the selection panel had the foresight to take Moeen out of the firing line until the last Test of the winter, in Christchurch. Hopefully, Smith will put a stop to that kind of lazy thinking. Of course, it’s a fine line to tread. He made a point in the ECB press release of saying that Malan’s game was ‘better suited to overseas conditions’, which was refreshingly honest but perhaps not what Malan needed to hear in that moment. When I used to work with Duncan Fletcher, he was always careful not to make statements that might come back to haunt him. Malan has now been pigeon-holed as a guy who won’t be picked in England. Perhaps Smith will have a chat on the phone with him over the next few days to explain exactly what he meant. On the whole, though, I like his approach, not least the fact that he’s happy to judge a guy by his character — no matter how young. When Duncan came in, there were lots of calls to drop some of the old-timers like Mike Atherton, Graham Thorpe, Alec Stewart and Darren Gough. We resisted those calls but ended up taking some inexperienced players to South Africa, where only one of the new selections — Michael Vaughan — made the grade. Smith is being more rigorous than that. He’s talking to people to find out what makes a player tick and whether they can handle the pressure. Curran’s all-round performance at Edgbaston was a case in point. Yes, he’ll get the odd one wrong. If Buttler had begun against Pakistan with nought and one, his scores against India, people would have been questioning Smith’s sanity. But he’s operating on the basis that, over time, if he selects the players he believes are best for England, the team will benefit. He’s prepared to put his neck on the line for the players. And that’s exactly what Joe Root needs."
"Football was coming home three weeks ago. Or so we hoped, as England reached the World Cup semi-final. But now, 600 miles away in northern Italy, he’s coming home. Mr AC Milan, aka Paolo Maldini, is back at the club he loves after an awkward nine-year absence. New club owners Elliott, an American hedge fund, have been appointing staff at remarkable speed. The Maldini news mutated from rumour to fact in the space of two days over the weekend.  On Sunday afternoon Milan released a statement which announced the former captain as the club’s first ‘sporting strategy and development director’. At his unveiling press conference on Monday afternoon, during the grandly hashtagged #MaldiniDay, the one club man said, ‘I will be working with the first team, the youth teams, on transfers and with the first team coach.’  He also confessed that there were still a few details to be ironed out, but promised that he, head coach Gennaro Gattuso and new chief executive Leonardo would be ‘in charge of all on pitch activity.’ The fact he is back in the fold is a feather in Elliott’s cap. The five-time Champions League winner had become an increasingly detached figure, and his lack of involvement with the team he served for 25 years was a painful, at times mystifying situation.  Cold War A difficult relationship with some of the team’s more fanatical supporters, the Ultras, caused his original reluctance to go back. After clashes with outspoken fan group leaders, and public comments against them, the captain became a target for a small but influential section of the San Siro. Maldini refused to attend Ultra meetings and events, actively condemning their attitude and all forms of violence or intimidation. His final home game in May 2009 should have been a glorious send-off but was a controversial affair. A small minority in the Curva Sud (the south end) displayed banners which claimed he had been a snob and not paid enough respect to the fans (ultras) who had ‘made him rich’. Another large message read: ‘The people you called mercenaries and misers thank you for your glorious 25 years of service’.  The malcontents taunted their departing skipper by singing the name of Franco Baresi, who had a closer connection with certain areas of the support.   Maldini felt the directors could have prevented this unpleasant episode, and that chief executive Adriano Galliani should have defended him. He allegedly never forgave Galliani, and subsequently turned down attempts by the club to hire him in a coaching or directorial role. The official line was always that the retired superstar didn’t think the offers suited him, but the genuine motive was his icy rapport with Galliani. Plus Maldini wanted to be in charge and his own man. That would never have been possible with Galliani still around. When asked about those unsavoury times and his issues with the ultras at his press conference, the elder statesman said he wanted to ‘leave it in the past. I have a great relationship with the fans, they love me, they have always shown that’. Then, when Chinese owners bought the club in 2017, new efforts were made to recruit the princely ex-No3. They too were snubbed. Maldini revealed that he had always listened to all previous offers, but his potential position ‘was never well defined’. Privately it’s believed he wasn’t convinced by the longevity and credibility of Li’s operation. Since retiring he has pursued other projects, including the foundation of American club Miami FC. And for the record, his suspicion of the Chinese management was justified. Elliott, on the other hand, are a different matter. The group, chaired by 71-year-old Paul Singer, had the credentials to impress a man as wise and worldly as Maldini. Across Italy and social media his return has been treated like something from Greek mythology or Lord of the Rings. He’ll bring his expertise on and off the pitch, and international appeal. Even those who never saw him play know that he is a living legend. Everything he touches turns to gold. He even made his professional tennis debut last year, aged 49. The new face of AC Milan is the old face. With the looks and physique of a Hollywood leading man, and a lifetime of top level football knowledge. Years of Discontent The return of the golden boy, whose father Cesare was also a European Cup-winning skipper, is the latest chapter in a tumultuous few years for Milan supporters. The red and black faithful have seen it all since the Silvio Berlusconi presidency came to a difficult end. Cost cutting enforced a slew of big names leaving and slowed down the parade of trophies. Berlusconi sold to mysterious Chinese businessman named Li Yonghong, nicknamed 'Mr Li' by the bemused media, amid much cynicism. Little was known about the new ownership and their resources, so Elliott were enlisted to undersign Li’s venture. Last summer the new ‘Chinese Milan’ launched an extravagant spending spree, including the arrival of Leonardo Bonucci from rivals Juventus. They splashed out almost £200m on a host of new players, but no one knew where that money came from. UEFA weren’t enamoured with these unorthodox finances. After months of investigation the governing body barred the Rossoneri from all European competition in June. When Li’s organisation failed to process one too many payments on time, Elliott seized control of the club four weeks ago. The Chinese era was history. Fans feared the worst and expected Elliott to sell of what few assets the squad still boasted, including Spanish winger Suso and teenage goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. But the Americans made it clear that they understood the prestige of the club, swiftly demonstrating their positive intentions. American Revolution The New York based group have been ruthlessly efficient. Marco Fassone and Massimiliano Mirabelli, executives of the Mr Li stewardship, were axed. Fassone, was dismissed with ‘just cause’ and denied a pay-off (he is taking legal action worth around £9m). In a short time Elliott have got supporters onboard. They convinced UEFA to re-instate the team to the 2018-19 Europa League. It might not be the Champions League, but it’s the only European competition the Rossoneri haven’t won. They installed a new president, lifelong Milan fan and businessman Paolo Scaroni. He made a good impression when he phoned head coach and San Siro idol Gennaro ‘Ringhio’ Gattuso. Rumours of Antonio Conte replacing Gattuso cropped up as soon as the ex-Chelsea man was released by the Blues. Scaroni showed a touch of class by making direct contact with Gattuso. The Americans have done their research. You can’t last over forty years as a hedge fund if you don’t prepare fastidiously. Their next masterstroke was summoning a familiar, floppy-haired Brazilian. Leonardo, who won the league with Milan in 1998-99, came in as sporting director. Born: June 26, 1968 – Milan Playing position: defender Clubs: 1985-2009 AC Milan (902 games) Honours: 5x Champions League, 7x Serie A, 1x Coppa Italia, 1x Club World Cup (+ 2x Intercontinental Cup) International: 1988-2002 Italy (126 caps, seven goals) The 60-cap international, who was also coach of the club in 2009-10, is a natural fit for the job. He wore the colours with distinction, is well connected, and very television and media friendly. The former midfielder is a multicultural polyglot with an eye for young talent in his homeland (he notified Milan about Kaka, Pato and Thiago Silva). Leonardo’s first act was brokering the return of namesake Bonucci to Juventus, with proven goalscorer Gonzalo Higuain and promising young centre-back Mattia Caldara making the reverse journey to the San Siro. Higuain has his critics, but in Serie A he guarantees goals and could be the man to break the curse of the red and black No 9. Since Filippo Inzaghi’s prolific reign of terror, all strikers wearing that jersey have struggled. Alessandro Matri, Luiz Adriano, Fernando Torres, Mattia Destro and Andre Silva toiled. Poor Pato was plagued by injuries. Tenacious and fearless Caldara, 24, is expected to form a fine partnership with Alessio Romagnoli in the heart of defence. If the pair click, they could be ‘the future’, as Maldini described them. And not just for the Rossoneri, but Italy. There is still debate among calcio fans over who got the best out of the Caldara-Bonucci swap and the loan of Higuaín for an initial £16m. Make no mistake, the ‘Milanisti’ are very pleased with their side of the deal. But the return of Maldini has dwarfed everything that has happened so far. His homecoming has been treated with an almost biblical significance. He is the man who gave everything for the seven times European champions, before walking away under a cloud. The recent highs and lows at Milan are extreme, even by top level sport’s standards. But after finishing last season with a whimper, and an early summer blemished by doubt, the red and black half of the city is smiling again. The prodigal son is back. Paolo’s coming home."
"Joe Hart will complete his move from Manchester City to Burnley on Tuesday. The former England No 1 will sign a two-year contract with Sean Dyche's side, with the option of an extra season. Burnley, who already have Tom Heaton and Nick Pope on their books, will pay in the region of £3.5million for Hart.  Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the 27-year-old was set to bring his 12-year stay at City to an end after falling out of favour under Pep Guardiola. He spent last season on loan at West Ham, but failed to impress enough to be included in Gareth Southgate's World Cup squad. Hart also spent the 2016-17 campaign on loan at Serie A side Torino, making 37 appearances before returning to England.  The 31-year-old will take a significant pay cut to move to Turf Moor as he looks to challenge Pope and Heaton for the No 1 spot this season.  Sportsmail understands City will be due payments from the Clarets depending on their progression in the Europa League and Premier League. Hart is understood to be enthused by the move, citing the chance to play European football, and would be expected to start the third qualifying round first leg away at Istanbul Basaksehir this week. Dyche is in the middle of a goalkeeping crisis after Pope dislocated his shoulder away at Aberdeen. He is expected to face months on the sidelines after suffering a similar problem to the one that finished Heaton’s season last September. Dyche has reservations over the immediate fitness of Heaton, who has not played for 11 months and is currently struggling with a calf injury.

"Manchester United have 'tabled a final bid of £40million for Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld' as they seek to bolster their defence before the transfer window closes on Thursday. Jose Mourinho has made it clear to the Old Trafford hierarchy that a new central defender is a priority but United appear no closer to landing any of their targets. According to the Daily Mirror, they will offer Tottenham £40m for the Belgian in a take it or leave it offer that still falls some way short of the London club's valuation of £55m. Mourinho has instructed the club to explore other possibilities if Tottenham don't want to sell Alderweireld, with an enquiry made for Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng. But Alderweireld remains the No 1 target for United though Spurs want at least £50m for a player who has just nine months remaining on his contract. Spurs do have an option to extend Alderweireld's contract by another 12 months, but that would automatically trigger a clause which allows him to leave for £25m. United were keen on Leicester City and England centre-half Harry Maguire following his impressive World Cup, but the Foxes have told them he is not for sale at any price. Mourinho's side host Leicester in their opening Premier League fixture on Friday evening.  "
"Everton have signed exciting Brazilian forward Bernard after holding off interest from at home and abroad. The deal will be announced on Tuesday, subject to a work permit, with Bernard due for a medical on Merseyside. The free transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk is seen as a coup for Goodison Park manager Marco Silva, whose personal intervention swung the deal Everton's way. The Brazilian winger has spent the last five seasons at Shakhtar Donetsk. He played 157 times for the Ukrainian club and scored 28 goals. Bernard started his career at Atletico Mineiro, where he won the Copa Libertadores in 2013. He moved to Shakhtar for around £40million that summer and won three Ukrainian league titles. He has played 14 times for Brazil and started the 7-1 defeat by Germany in the 2014 World Cup semi-finals. His nickname, given to him by former Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, translates to 'joy in the legs' and is reference to his dribbling ability. Bernard, 25, had been considering offers from Chelsea and West Ham as well as AC Milan and Inter Milan. Italian media were even heralding his impending arrival in Serie A. Tottenham were also linked with the player but had not made their intentions clear. Ambitious West Ham, big spenders in this window, were confident at the end of last week but were unclear about his role in their team, which is already packed with attacking flair. Bernard, with 14 caps for Brazil and who cost Shakhtar £40million, can play as an inside forward coming off the left side or as a No 10 behind a striker. He is understood to be relishing the chance to form an exciting partnership with fellow Brazilian Richarlison, signed last month from Watford. With the transfer window closing on Thursday, Everton are delighted to have sealed a deal despite late interest from Chelsea. Bernard's arrival is likely to pave the way for 29-year-old winger Yannick Bolasie to return to Crystal Palace.  The Congolese winger has been told he has no future under Silva and is waiting for Palace to agree a deal. Championship managers also showed interest, along with clubs in Turkey. Everton, however, hope to complete further signings before Thursday. Talks are continuing with Stoke City over £14m-rated midfielder Badou Ndiaye while they are waiting for Argentina centre back Marcos Rojo to be given the all-clear to leave Manchester United. A £28m fee for Barcelona defender Yerry Mina has been outlined but Rojo has always been Everton's top target. Everton face competition from Lyon for Mina who has also had an approach from Manchester United.  Mina was discussed as part of a proposed deal for France's World Cup-winning midfielder Paul Pogba which has since been dismissed by United."
"Jose Mourinho's complaints over Manchester United's misfortune have been silenced by a new study which concludes they were in fact one of the luckiest teams in the Premier League last season. Research conducted by ESPN in partnership with Intel and the University of Bath has concluded that Manchester United gained an extra six points through good fortune while Liverpool missed out on a significant 12, making them the unluckiest team.  A total of 157 incidents throughout the 2017-18 campaign, including incorrectly disallowed goals, wrongly awarded penalties and improper red card decisions, were reversed before a powerful predictive model readjusted results to produce a Premier League table without the factor of Lady Luck. The final table shows Liverpool moving up to second with 87 points and Manchester United dropping to fourth. Manchester City remain champions but finish with 97 points while Tottenham remain in third with their luck evening out over the course of the season. It will prove difficult reading for Mourinho, who last season insinuated that referees were costing Manchester United. One of his more thinly-veiled criticisms came after his side failed to beat Southampton at Old Trafford in December. Speaking of Craig Pawson's failure to give his side a penalty during the 0-0 draw, Mourinho said: 'It is a penalty like [Marcus] Rashford against Leicester, [Ander] Herrera against City. [Jonathan] Moss, [Michael] Oliver and Craig tonight are good referees. So the referees' performances in these matches were good – these were unlucky decisions that punished us. 'A very good referee, one of the most promising young referees in Europe, had a very bad decision that punished.' Mourinho also claimed earlier in the season that rivals Manchester City were being protected by 'good luck'. As it turns out, the sun was shining brighter on Old Trafford across the season. One manager who certainly does have the right to complain about his fortune is the now-ousted Paul Lambert, who would still be in the job at the bet365 Stadium had Stoke not missed out on the four points lost through poor decisions. With Huddersfield remaining on the 37 points they actually finished on, the Potters would have vaulted them and remained in the Premier League. Instead, they fell to the Championship and will miss out on vast sums in TV revenue as a result. Many millions more were lost and gained as a result of dodgy decisions. Brighton would have an extra £11.5m with the six points they were denied, which would have taken them up to ninth. Leicester, the luckiest team in the division, earned an additional £96m thanks to their seven bonus points. Arsene Wenger's last season in charge of Arsenal would have been made slightly better with the additional eight points that bad luck cost them. They missed out on a notable 11 points away from home, which helps to explain a pitiful return of just 16 points on the road, but gained an additional three at home. It still would not have been enough to get them into the Champions League places, but they would have finished fifth, above Chelsea, with 71 points. The study is only likely to increase pressure on the Premier League to introduce VAR after its successful implementation at the World Cup this summer. Video replays helped to overturn significant decisions in games involving England, Brazil and the winners France, but the technology was rejected by Premier League clubs in April. "
"Mike Ashley says he is being treated as a ‘pantomime villain’ over his running of Newcastle — and that a parliamentary petition against him led to employees of his companies receiving ‘unprecedented’ levels of abuse, harassment and intimidation. The claims are contained in a letter sent last week to secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Wright, in response to a parliamentary petition raised by Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle Central. In the letter, dated August 3, Ashley fiercely defends his stewardship of the club, setting out the levels of investment during his takeover and Newcastle’s commitment to community projects since. Onwurah had stated Ashley should offer more support to manager Rafa Benitez and that this ‘should include investment in players, training facilities and community engagement’. It is the sweeping nature of the criticism that appears to have angered Ashley who calls the petition ‘irresponsible and misleading’. He adds that some of the obscene calls and material received by staff at companies including Sports Direct have been referred to the police. It is the latest development in a summer of escalating tensions at St James’ Park, largely focused on Ashley’s perceived lack of investment.  While six players have arrived in this transfer window, the combined cost of Martin Dubravka, Fabian Schar, Yoshinori Muto, Kenedy and Ki Sung-yueng and Salomon Rondon is only £10.5million. TRANSFERS IN  Martin Dubravka (Sparta Prague) Fabian Schar (Deportivo) Yoshinori Muto (Mainz) Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea)  Kenedy (Chelsea - Loan)  Salomon Rondon (West Brom - Loan) Total: £10.5m TRANSFERS OUT Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham)  Alex Gilliead (Shrewsbury) Massadio Haidara (Lens) Chancel Mbemba (Porto) Matz Sels (Strasbourg) Dwight Gayle (West Brom - Loan) Total: £43.5m Against that, Newcastle have raised £43.5m in sales, including a £22m fee from Fulham for Aleksandar Mitrovic. To complicate matters, Ashley insists on meeting all transfer fees in full and up front — to minimise liability in the event the club is sold — while buyers often pay Newcastle in instalments. Benitez is complaining of lost transfer opportunities and said at the weekend that he and Ashley were not going in the same direction. Benitez’s mounting dissatisfaction provoked Onwurah’s petition, presented to parliament on July 24 and awaiting a response from the secretary of state. By pre-empting that, Ashley clearly hopes his reaction will be taken into account. He concludes by offering to answer any further questions the department may have. The letter — sent by email and post and seen by Sportsmail — accuses Onwurah of presenting ‘a wholly inaccurate assessment of the situation at Newcastle’. Ashley then defends his record, stating he has provided the club with £144m in interest-free loans, while writing off third-party debts of £76m and incurring finance costs of £6.5m. He says this is responsible for season-ticket price freezes and reductions benefiting 20,000 supporters. Other parts of the letter appear to answer Onwurah’s criticism of poor training facilities and community engagement. ‘Our training facilities have greatly improved during my tenure,’ Ashley writes, ‘and very clearly do not have a negative impact on performance, given we secured a place in the top 10 of the Premier League last season.’ He compares Newcastle’s instant return from relegation with the fortunes of significant rivals including Aston Villa, Sunderland, Leeds and Nottingham Forest. He writes of providing ‘continued financial support’. Finally, Ashley blames Onwurah for verbal and social media attacks on his staff. He insists: ‘Following publication of the petition, an unprecedented volume of unacceptable abuse was directed towards staff at Sports Direct and its associated companies, via social media, email and telephone. ‘This included digital material of an obscene nature, incitement to commit criminal damage and language that was clearly intended to intimidate and harass staff. We are in the process of bringing examples of this behaviour to the attention of police.’ Whether Ashley’s letter earns much sympathy on Tyneside, however, is unlikely. Benitez is plainly winning the battle for supporters’ hearts and minds, and a campaign ‘If Rafa goes, we go’ advocates boycotting the club if the manager decides his position is untenable. Ashley’s critics are sure to contrast his concern for Sports Direct staff with a 2016 report into working conditions at the company’s Shirebrook warehouse, in which members of the parliamentary Business, Skills and Innovation Committee drew comparisons with a Victorian workhouse."
"Thibaut Courtois has failed to report for training at Chelsea in an attempt to force a move to Real Madrid. The London club are open to doing a deal before Thursday’s deadline but want £45million for the Belgium goalkeeper. They also want a deal in place for a replacement before letting Courtois to leave. Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak, Leicester’s Kasper Schmeichel, Stoke’s Jack Butland and Sevilla’s Sergio Rico are being considered. However, team-mate Eden Hazard has been told he will not be sold. The Belgium forward is understood to have accepted the decision and will not push for a move. Courtois, who spent three seasons at Atletico Madrid, has told Chelsea he intends to return to the Spanish capital this summer. With just 12 months left on his contract, there is an urgency for Chelsea to find a resolution rather than lose him for nothing next summer. They had tried to persuade Courtois to sign a new deal worth £200,000 a week but the chances of him changing his mind are remote. Manager Maurizio Sarri had insisted he wanted Courtois to tell him face-to-face of his intention to leave, but the 25-year-old has failed to return on time from his post-World Cup holiday. The lines of communication between Chelsea and Real have been open for several weeks but a fee is yet to be agreed. Securing a replacement is also an obstacle, with Sarri wanting a keeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet. Jordan Pickford is a target but Everton are unlikely to sell their 24-year-old England No 1. Schmeichel, 31, and 24-year-old Rico are on the radar, but a deal for England international Butland, now playing in the Championship, would be far more straight forward. Willian, who has been linked with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona, has pledged to stay at Stamford Bridge. ‘I’m a Chelsea player,’ Willian told ESPN Brazil. ‘I always made it clear that what I wanted was to stay in the club. The only club I knew that made an official offer for me was Barcelona. ‘But I have my head here and I intend to continue in the club unless the club wants to sell me.’"
"Willian has attempted to explain what happened over the controversial Instagram post after Chelsea's FA Cup triumph at the end of last season. After Chelsea beat Manchester United 1-0 in last campaign's FA Cup final - with Eden Hazard scoring from the penalty spot - Willian took to Instagram to post a picture of the team celebrating with the trophy on the pitch. But Willian, who came on as a 90th minute substitute at Wembley, altered the picture of the entire Chelsea team celebrating with their newly-won silverware by blocking out Antonio Conte's figure with three gold trophy emojis. And now over two months on from the final, the Brazilian midfielder has opened up on the much-spoken about social media post, claiming his daughter got hold of his phone. Willian told ESPN Brasil: 'My daughter was playing with my cell phone and she ended up putting those emojis over Conte.  'After the final I got a plane right after the game to come to Brazil. When I got here, early in the morning, I was posting some pictures of the champions and, well, I was a bit too tired and ended up posting them like that.'  The Italian, having led Chelsea to the title the season before last,  cut an increasingly frustrated figure as his team failed to shine in the Premier League last term. And in the summer, Conte was replaced by Maurizio Sarri, who kicks off Chelsea's Premier League season against Huddersfield away.  Speaking ahead of the start of the season under new management, Willian admits Conte was 'difficult to work with'. 'I hope he (Sarri) is not like Conte,' Willian added. 'No, I'm kidding. For me, Conte was a manager who was very difficult to work with. His philosophy, his way of dealing with things is very complicated.'  "
"Despite his future at Manchester United looking all but over, Anthony Martial cut a relaxed figure as he posed alongside friends.  The French forward has seen his relationship with United boss Jose Mourinho fall to a new low after the pair clashed over the attacker's decision to leave the club's U.S. pre-season tour to be at the birth of his child. Posing in an all black ensemble, Martial wrote on Instagram that he was with seven friends who he has known 'since he was little'.  Appearances: 39 (18 starts, 12 from the bench) Minutes: 1584  Goals: 10  Assists: 5  While Mourinho has deemed Martial surplus to requirements, the Old Trafford hierarchy are keen to hold onto the 22-year-old, wary that he could embarrass the club by realising his potential at a rival club.  Likely to be valued at around £75million by United, Mourinho is keen to see that money reinvested in a replacement in the mould of someone like Inter's Ivan Perisic.  Mourinho also admires Chelsea attacker Willian but he clarified his future on Monday insisting his head is focused on Chelsea and the season ahead.  The key issue for both the player and the club is that the time is against them to make such a big-money deal happen before Thursday's Premier League deadline and there is a strong possibility the pair could be forced to work together - at least until January.   Three years ago he became the world's most expensive teenager when he swapped Monaco for Manchester but having initially excelled under Louis van Gaal, the young Frenchman has struggled to gain the trust of Mourinho.  Despite returning to training on Friday, he was not part of the squad that flew out to face Bayern Munich on Sunday, another timely reminder of Mourinho's attitude on the situation.  Mourinho wants two new faces before Thursday's deadline with Jerome Boateng, Harry Maguire, Toby Alderweireld, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Ousmane Dembele all on the radar. "
"Maurizio Sarri has been airing his concerns in private about the mess he inherited at Chelsea. An emphatic FA Community Shield defeat by Manchester City at Wembley, however, made it clear how much there is to do. Sarri has been dealt a rotten hand. Like the character played by Lloyd Bridges in Airplane, it looks like he picked the wrong day to quit smoking on the touchline. Chelsea try to avoid a full-scale summer tour in a World Cup year but were off to Australia within four days of the new manager’s appointment and soon training Down Under in heavy rain at the WACA. ‘Pre-season until now has been a bit crazy,’ said Sarri at Wembley on Sunday. ‘We have to work.’ At Napoli, he would retreat for three weeks to Dimaro Folgarida, a tiny resort in the foothills of the Dolomites, to work non-stop with his players. Two sessions a day on fitness, team shape and tactics. Practice matches would be played there behind closed doors, plus a low-key friendly in the area and three friendlies against elite opposition in Europe. At Sarri’s behest, Napoli are the last of the big Italian clubs to resist the lure of summer tours and the money-spinning global circus of the International Champions Cup (ICC). Chelsea’s ICC dates were thrown into chaos when Sevilla withdrew having landed in the Europa League qualifiers and a game against Inter Milan, set for Sweden, was moved to France after a venue mix-up. A game in Sweden versus Arsenal clashed with the Community Shield and was moved to Ireland. That left one fixture to be crammed in — against Lyon on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. ‘It is not easy in the next week,’ said Sarri after the 2-0 defeat by City. ‘We have a friendly but I prefer to stay on the pitch just for training.’ The last six players are back after the PFA-recommended three weeks’ rest following the World Cup. One of them, keeper Thibaut Courtois, went straight into talks about his wish to join Real Madrid and has now gone missing. Like Pep Guardiola at City, Sarri likes a goalkeeper comfortable with the ball at his feet so may not be averse to losing Courtois. Still, he will need a replacement. Willian has vowed to stay. ‘My head is here in the club,’ said the Brazilian but he was five days late for pre-season amid interest from Barcelona and Real. That went down badly with Sarri. Asked if any of his six late arrivals — Courtois, Eden Hazard, Michy Batshuayi, Gary Cahill, N’Golo Kante and Olivier Giroud — could play at Huddersfield on Saturday, Sarri said: ‘It’s a bit difficult, we can do it, but with just one or two.’ While expected to impose his adventurous style on the team, Sarri has only one new first-team player — Jorginho. He wanted Gonzalo Higuain and Juventus were keen to sell but his board saw no sense in paying £50million for the 30-year-old Argentinian striker when they had Alvaro Morata, Giroud and Batshuayi. AC Milan took Higuain on loan for £16m, with an option to buy for another £32m at the end of the season. They would sign him only if Juventus also swapped centre halves Mattia Caldara and Leonardo Bonucci, who sought a return to Turin after a year in Milan. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and director Marina Granovskaia met Juventus to discuss Higuain and Daniele Rugani, a defender who played for Sarri at Empoli. Chelsea offered £45m with add-ons for Rugani. Juventus are reluctant to sell. The deal is not completely cold but Sarri could be moulding a back four from the defenders who played in Antonio Conte’s back three for the past two years. An unsettling backdrop to all this is a change in Abramovich’s status since his UK visa expired and was not renewed. He has bought a home in Tel Aviv to take Israeli citizenship which allows him to visit the UK, but needs a visa to live or work here. How the Home Office will define ‘work’ is not yet clear. The talks with Juventus were in the south of France where Abramovich often spends time at his Antibes chateau at this time of year. Chelsea say his circumstances will not affect the running of the club, although he has shelved new stadium plans. Midfielder N’Golo Kante has become one of Europe’s most influential players, winning the title with Leicester and Chelsea, adding an FA Cup and then helping France to the World Cup — all in the space of three years. He usually operates freely in a midfield pair but Sarri looks set to stick with the 4-3-3 system which served him well at Napoli. Jorginho will be the fulcrum. Kante can adapt to a role on the right but will it diminish his influence? If so, should they sell him to Paris Saint-Germain to invest in ‘Sarrismo’? It is quite a call. The one thing Sarri has divulged on transfers is that he would like a midfielder with ‘different characteristics’. In Italy, this was received as confirmation of his interest in Matias Vecino of Inter Milan, a Uruguayan who offers height, athleticism, aerial presence and a goal threat without any loss of technique or defensive discipline. Having played for Sarri at Empoli, Vecino knows precisely what he expects from a midfield trio. It would take offers of around £45m to get Inter interested. The rebuild becomes increasingly expensive."
"Chelsea's Willian has spoken of his desire to one day work with Jose Mourinho again after labelling the Manchester United boss as 'the best manager I've worked with'. Willian played under Mourinho during the manager's second spell at Stamford Bridge. He credits the 55-year-old's quality as a manager for him winning his first Premier League winners' medal in 2015. Speaking in an interview with ESPN, Willian said: 'Mourinho is the best manager I've ever worked with. We have a good relationship, we are friends. 'Sometimes we talk, we text, we send messages to each other via WhatsApp. He is a great manager, I really enjoyed working with him. I hope I can work with him again someday.' There have been suggestions over the summer that Mourinho would want to bring Willian to Old Trafford. Willian has previously suggested that United made an approach for him last summer. This summer, however, Willian says he is not aware of any further interest from United. He said: 'I don't know if there was any official bid [from Manchester United], but some things have happened. 'Also, everything comes out on the internet, too. But Mourinho talks to my agent all the time, he says 'bring him, bring him'. Asked whether Mourinho has called him directly, Willian added: 'No, he has never called me, but he always sends me text messages. 'But I am very happy at Chelsea, I want to stay in the club. I also like living in London, it is an amazing city, and my family is well adapted. So yeah, I intend to stay at Chelsea.' "
Newcastle United's players have refused to interact with the media until there is a breakthrough in their dispute with the club over bonuses for the 2018-19 season. The Newcastle squad had been unwilling to take part in a video shoot for TV companies on Monday. The shoot had been set up to gather 'walk up' footage to be used when displaying team lineups as part of pre-match broadcasts. But owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley have not agreed to an incentivised package with the squad for the 2018-19 season and that means they have not been giving any media interview. That included no post-match chats with in-house channel nufcTV after pre-season games with Braga and Augsburg.  Sky Sports and BT Sport will once again share the rights to broadcast Premier League games live in the UK this season. Journalists and camera operators were at Newcastle's Benton Training Centre on Monday but left after the players did not appear to film the walk-up shots. The club and players were involved in a similar impasse over bonuses last season until Ashley intervened.  Newcastle's first match — at home to Tottenham on Saturday — has been scheduled to be shown live on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event. It is currently expected that Newcastle's players will not take part in media interviews unless the dispute is resolved.
"Dillian Whyte sacrificed his position as mandatory challenger to WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder when he declined to meet Luis Ortiz in an official final eliminator, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman has confirmed. The WBC will now permit Tyson Fury to challenge Wilder in November, if the negotiations for that fight are finalised as imminently as expected by the Gypsy King’s promoter Frank Warren. Sulaiman says: ‘Whyte is the holder of the WBC silver belt and was offered a final eliminator against Ortiz but did not want that fight.’ Whyte preferred the non-title street brawl against Joseph Parker which sold out London’s 02 Arena last Saturday night. His promoter Eddie Hearn will now pursue a challenge for Manuel Charr’s WBA ‘regular’ title, thereby heightening expectation that Whyte, not Wilder, will be Anthony Joshua’s opponent at Wembley next April. The outlandish Fury has already claimed a deal has been struck with Wilder's camp despite already having a fight against Francesco Pianeta to overcome.  'It's finally going to happen, providing I beat Pienata,' Fury told Behind The Gloves. 'I don't know what he (Wilder) is going to do if he has a fight in between or not but he will have to beat his mandatory in Brazil if he does, and then it's a collision course.  'I just hope we put on a massive, massive show for the fans.' The news that Wilder will not have to meet either Whyte or Ortiz should allow the bout with Fury to happen earlier than anticipated. Anthony Joshua had tried to lure Wilder into a money-spinning showdown for all the belts, but talks broke down in the summer with Hearn claiming the American's demands were impossible to meet.  Fury claimed his deal with Wilder was completed two days after negotiations begun.  'It's been very very easy to make this fight,' Fury added. 'I've heard these promoters speaking bull**** that he's (Wilder) been making demands that can't be met, but I haven't found that to be the case at all.  'We have basically done this deal in two days. It has been the most straightforward and least complicated deal I have ever done and found him and his team gentlemen to deal with.'"
"Mauricio Pochettino is not ruling out England duo Harry Kane and Dele Alli for Saturday’s season opener at Newcastle. The star pair — along with fellow England stars Kieran Trippier, Danny Rose and Eric Dier — reported for duty after their involvement in England’s uplifting run to the World Cup semi-final. And despite the game at St. James’ Park being just five days away, manager Pochettino is ready to include key-men Kane and Alli in the travelling party.  Kane is eager to play some part against the Magpies, while Alli could also have some involvement against Newcastle. Both have intimated that they are keen to play some part this weekend. Pochettino will assess his returning stars — which also include Hugo Lloris, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen — before making a final decision on who will be available. The Argentine, though, insists he will not gamble with any of his players’ fitness.  ‘Always we need to assess them. We will see on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday then Thursday and Friday to take a decision for the team,’ said Pochettino. ‘If some players are ready, of course we are going to use them but we are not going to take some risks because sometimes for one game, you lose the players for one month or two months and that is (why it’s) so important to be clever in the decisions that we are going to take.’ Meanwhile,  midfielder Mousa Dembele has rejected a £20million move to Inter Milan. The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract but has turned down the Serie A giants to remain in North London, despite falling down the pecking order under Pochettino. Dembele, who was part of the Belgium squad at the World Cup in Russia, started 21 matches last season in the Premier League but saw Victor Wanyama picked ahead of him in the latter stages. The Italians have already signed Radja Nainggolan from Roma this summer and wanted to pair him with Belgian team-mate Dembele next season. Dembele is still one of the stand-out performers in the Premier League but he is understood to be looking to wind down his career as he struggles with the physical demands of the English season."
"Salomon Rondon has completed his loan move to Newcastle, with fellow striker Dwight Gayle moving to West Brom as part of the deal. A key target for manager Rafa Benitez, Rondon had been the subject of two failed bids as the Magpies initially struggled to meet West Brom's asking price. But the addition of Gayle - who struck 23 times in the Championship in 2016-17 - into the deal eventually convinced West Brom to part with the 28-year-old forward. The Venezuelan international becomes Newcastle's sixth summer signing following the arrivals of Martin Dubravka, Kenedy, Ki Sung-yueng, Fabian Schar and Yoshinori Muto. And after finalising the move, Rondon expressed his pride at joining 'one of the biggest clubs in the Premier League'. 'It's an honour to be here and I'm excited to get started with my team mates,' he said. 'The clubs were talking for a long time and now I'm focused on the season to help my team mates to get the points to do well this season. 'It's one of the biggest clubs in the Premier League and I knew about the interest of the gaffer, so I'm happy to be here.'   As reported by Sportsmail over the weekend, manager Benitez had quickly grown frustrated over Newcastle's lack of activity in the market. He suggested that the club's board had let him and his players down in the transfer market this summer, and also claimed that the club would be heading for a relegation battle if they failed to bring in significant reinforcements before Thursday's deadline. 'The players know,' he said. 'They want to have better players around because they have more possibilities to win.' 'To balance the team we need four players. Can we do it? Yes. Can we do the ideal window now? It's impossible because we have lost the opportunities. It's a pity that after two months we are talking about the last five days. 'It will be more difficult than last year. Wolves, Fulham, Cardiff, especially the first two, are spending money. Crystal Palace, West Ham, everyone is spending money.'"
"Mohamed Salah's talent with a football is not in doubt following his stunning maiden campaign with Liverpool last season. But his skills behind the wheel might need a bit more honing before his Anfield team-mates allow him to drive them forward off the pitch as well as on it. Speaking on a commercial the Egyptian star revealed he struggled to get to grips with driving on the road in the United Kingdom. 'In the first few week it was hard,' Salah said. 'I had couple of accidents when I did drive on the sidewalk, but then everything worked just fine.' Salah arrived at Liverpool last season for a fee worth £39million with a point to prove in the Premier League having previously failed to make an impact with Chelsea. But the forward made a stunning impact on Merseyside, firing in a stunning 44 goals to become the Premier League's top scorer as well as help guide the Reds towards the Champions League final Questioned on his favourite achievement in his highly successful first season at Liverpool, Salah stated that becoming the Premier League's top scorer was his highlight. '[Winning the] golden boot for sure,' Salah added. 'I had to work hard for that, and concentrate on every match to score, also I had to fight for it with a great players as Harry Kane and [Sergio] 'Kun' Aguero.' With Liverpool having been bolstered by summer signings including Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri, they will now hope that Salah can finally steer them towards a first league title since 1990."
"Not for the first time this summer, Jose Mourinho has turned the spotlight on Manchester United chief Ed Woodward as the clock ticks down towards the end of the transfer window. ‘My CEO knows what I want for quite a long time, I know he tries to do the best for me and I still have a few days to wait to see what happens,’ said Mourinho on Sunday, echoing comments he made during an extraordinary outburst on tour in Michigan last month. ‘If we don’t make our team better it will be a difficult season for us.’ The message was simple: over to you, Ed. It is a not-so-tactful ploy by Mourinho to exert pressure on Woodward, and another sign that all is not well between the manager and executive vice-chairman.  Anyone who witnessed the meeting between the two men in the tunnel after United’s final tour game against Real Madrid in Miami could see the awkward body language. With just three days to go until the window closes, Sportsmail analyses United’s transfer strategy and the relationship between the two men behind it. What is Woodward and Mourinho’s relationship like? Increasingly strained. While some inside Old Trafford would say it’s not as bad as it has been painted in recent weeks, the meeting in the tunnel told its own story. Mourinho had spent much of the tour in a mood because of what he perceives to be a lack of progress in the transfer market. It came to a head in Michigan and when Woodward caught up with his manager in Miami, Mourinho’s displeasure was plain to see. The United boss is known to feel that Woodward could have acted more quickly on certain targets. It’s understood that he mentioned Harry Maguire before the World Cup but the Leicester defender’s performances in Russia mean that he is now almost unobtainable. Similarly, Jerome Boateng has been a potential target for some time but United only returned to the German defender following their friendly against Bayern Munich on Sunday. Mourinho was known to be irked by the club’s failure to meet Inter Milan’s valuation of Ivan Perisic last summer, and the Croat’s success in getting to the World Cup final has only increased his value as well. The United manager’s decision to out Woodward twice in quick succession is a sign of his frustration, and the Old Trafford chief will not appreciate the added pressure any more than he did Mourinho’s comments about the tour games not being worth the ticket price. What are Mourinho’s demands before the transfer window shuts? As he keeps saying, he wants two players – a centre-back and a winger – but suspects he will only get one at best. The defender seems to be the most pressing option after United expressed an interest in Boateng, Maguire and Toby Alderweireld, although you wonder if they would be a significant upgrade on Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Eric Lindelof. Ideally, Mourinho would like to sell Anthony Martial and bring in a replacement winger such as Perisic, but that is very unlikely to happen. Where do Mourinho and Woodward differ on those plans? Mourinho is more interested in experienced, older players who can make an impact now. Woodward knows he has to have an eye on the future and the re-sale value of a player. Boateng, for instance, would cost between £40-50million but turns 30 next month. Perisic is 30 in February, Alderweireld in March. The only common ground seems to be that Rojo will the defender sacrificed to make way for a new man, with Everton ready to sign the Argentine for £30m. It is an intriguing difference of approach between a manager who is entering the third – and, in Mourinho’s case – usually final – season and his boss who is looking to the future. Nowhere is that more evident than the situation with Martial. Mourinho wants to wash his hands of the young Frenchman while Woodward believes he will come good at Old Trafford and fears being embarrassed if Martial blossoms at a rival club. Luke Shaw is another example of a young player who has been frozen out by Mourinho at times, yet retains the support of the club’s hierarchy. Which names will Woodward be chasing? Boateng, Maguire, Alderweireld. United’s plans seem to be boiling down to getting a defender before the deadline, although they have pulled off some surprise transfers in the past and you wouldn’t put it past Woodward again. What is Woodward’s history of getting successful deals done? He is a highly astute businessman who is credited with generating huge commercial revenue off the back of United’s popularity around the world, and has taken that expertise into the transfer market. Woodward has completed a then world record deal for Paul Pogba as well as signing the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Romelu Lukaku, Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria in recent years. Some have worked out, others less so, but there is no doubt that Woodward has re-established United as one of the big spenders on the world stage, albeit with limited success. For him, spending £89m on Pogba was an important statement of intent that was well worth the money rather than an expensive gamble. With the deadline approaching, and United flush – surely they might be ripped off by other clubs? Of course. Everyone knows Woodward is under pressure from a manager who will not be shy in demonstrating his feelings if he doesn’t get what he wants. Mourinho has put him in the spotlight and that means other clubs can use it to their advantage. United are known to be reluctant to pay £75m for Maguire or £50m for Boateng, but time is against them. How likely is Woodward to get a signing over the line before Thursday? The feeling is, he has to. It was clear from what happened last season that United need to strengthen, and the announcement of Fred’s £52m move from Shakhtar Donetsk seems a long time ago now. Even if it’s not Mourinho’s first choice, a new signing would lift the club after a difficult pre-season. Fortunately, Woodward has the track record and financial muscle to get the job done. "
"Wolves expect to complete the £20m signing of Adama Traore from Middlesbrough over the next 24 hours.  Traore was set to undergo a medical on Monday ahead of his club-record move from Middlesbrough. Wolves are believed to be paying an initial £10m up front for the pacey winger and then the rest of the fee will come in installments. Those could take the total fee to over £20m, depending on the number of appearances he makes among other things. Last season Traore, who joined from Aston Villa in 2016, scored five goals and provided ten assists for Middlesbrough across 36 Championship appearances. It means Nuno Espirito Santo has added another new face to his Wolves squad after already completing deals for Raul Jimenez, Joao Moutinho and Ruo Patricio among others. Wolves begin their long-awaited return to the Premier League at home to Everton on Saturday. "
"Manchester United's Brazilian duo Fred and Andreas Pereira have been enjoying some downtime ahead of the new Premier League season. The two midfielders met for a spot of lunch at the Piccolino Restaurant in Cheshire on Monday afternoon. Fred, who signed for United earlier this summer for £52million, showed up in his new red Range Rover before meeting his team-mate in Hale Village. Fred looks likely to make his competitive debut for Jose Mourinho's United on Friday evening as they open the 2018-19 Premier League campaign against Leicester City at Old Trafford.  Pereira, who has spent the last two seasons on loan at two different Spanish clubs, looks set to fight for his place at the club this season. Mourinho is still desperate for new recruits ahead of Thursday's deadline having signed only Fred, Diogo Dalot and goalkeeper Lee Grant this summer. United are currently in discussions with Bayern over a deal for centre back Jerome Boateng with former target Yerry Mina set to join Everton from Barcelona.  The Red Devils are also targeting Toby Alderweireld in a bid to shore up their defence but Tottenham are holding out for £60million. "
"There would be a certain irony in Pittodrie being the venue at which Steven Gerrard reached for a page straight out of the Sir Alex Ferguson playbook. Angered by the performance of referee Kevin Clancy and his assistants, the Rangers manager created eye-catching headlines after his domestic debut in charge of the club. It was one thing to state he felt the world was against his ten-man side in their 1-1 draw against Aberdeen. To follow up by effectively claiming the nation's referees have given Rangers a rough ride for seasons added no little piquancy to his entry into Scottish Premiership action. Only Gerrard knows whether his comments were born purely of frustration or carried some wider intention. But he wouldn't exactly be the first manager to try and foster a siege mentality within his dressing room. Ferguson famously did so to great effect during his time at Aberdeen - when he would point fingers at the west-coast bias of the media - and again during his legendary 26-year spell in charge at Old Trafford. 'He persuaded us Manchester United are the team everyone loves to hate,' Ryan Giggs once recalled. 'He makes us feel everyone wants us to come second and it is us against the world. He lays down the challenge for you to take up.' Is Gerrard seeking a similar reaction? Former Ibrox striker Gordon Dalziel believes that may well have been the intention behind the double-barrelled blast that opened his tenure with a sizeable bang. Dalziel, though, is sceptical about the need for such an approach and questions whether the heat of the moment took its toll. 'Steven Gerrard might see it as: 'Right, we're all going to have this bubble, we'll stick together, we'll beat the world and this will make us stronger,' said Dalziel, who covered Sunday's game in his role as a radio pundit with Clyde 1. ‘It might be a process for him where he thinks he can bring the boys together by saying everyone is against them and no-one wants them to win. 'Is it for me? Honestly, no. To say that decisions have gone against them for years, I thought that was the wrong statement for Steven Gerrard to make. 'Are you telling me he has watched the Rangers games for the last two or three years and noted down the decisions? Come on. He has been terrific for the Scottish game. 'He has brought excitement and I think he has said good and positive things. 'You have remember this is his first job and that was his first game against a domestic rival. Emotions go high, especially when they are so hard done by to only come away with a point. 'I have been there. You go into a press room after a game and you say things. Then you sit back at night, relax a bit, the adrenaline stops and you think: ""What the hell did I say that for?"" 'I don't know, that might not be the case at all here... Steven might be delighted he said that. 'But you could go and interview a manager anywhere and they’d say they didn’t get decisions at certain times. ‘If he feels that saying those words can be an ammunition for the Rangers players and it works then fair play to him. Personally, I don’t think it’s an avenue he needs to go down as I feel he handles everything extremely well.’  There was certainly enough to raise Gerrard’s blood pressure at Pittodrie. He was upset by the officials failing to notice the ‘provocation’ of Scott McKenna’s barges before showing Alfredo Morelos a 12th minute red card for kicking out at the Aberdeen defender. Rangers have now lodged an appeal against that punishment with the SFA. Then came Dom Ball’s tug on Josh Windass. While Clancy awarded a penalty that James Tavernier converted, Gerrard was baffled at the failure to show the Dons right-back even a yellow card. Rangers continued to look the superior side despite their disadvantage, but were denied an opening victory when youngster Bruce Anderson netted a 93rd minute leveller with the home side’s first shot on target. Former Rangers boss Stuart McCall knows what that kind of finale can do to a manager’s mind-set. He reckons Gerrard had valid grievances on Sunday, yet doesn’t buy any idea that officials might have it in for his old club. ‘Listen, you hear these kind of things everywhere, be it from a (Jose) Mourinho or whoever,’ said McCall. ‘I think Steven comes across as a fair-minded person, so it might just have been a reaction. ‘He’s also in a situation where I can imagine him hearing everyone around him going on about decisions. People talk that way within clubs. ‘Jim McCluskey booked me three times in my first five games (as a player) in Scotland. At the time, I’m thinking: ""Oh, he’s against me, he’s against Rangers"". 'But I ended up thinking he was one of the best referees in the country. ‘I don’t think there is any agenda against any side. ‘It’s a tough job to ask someone to do because you can’t win.’ Sportsmail understands Gerrard is unlikely to face any SFA action over his comments, with a view that they fall just within the acceptable guidelines. ‘At Motherwell, I thought Clancy was one of the better referees who were up-and-coming at the time,’ added McCall. ‘They don’t give decisions with any favouritism but I get the frustration you feel at full-time. I’m not saying Scottish referees are the best but they do a job that is difficult. ‘There will be decisions in the next week, month and season that go against Rangers. But they will also go against other sides. ‘As much as you could see how proud Steven was of the performance - and he should be - deep down you are really disappointed as a manager because it was a game you should have won over the period.’ "
"Football is not alone in starting a new season with something to prove. This weekend the Premier League kicks off its attempt to mirror the dazzling spectacle of a World Cup which restored international football as the elite pinnacle of the global game. One week later big-time boxing returns striving to overcome the loss - temporary or otherwise - of what should have been the world heavyweight title fight of the decade. Each to their own challenge. For boxing, the failure of Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder to come to terms for a match which would have given the sport its first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis is just about the only question mark against the hard old game's brilliant renaissance this year. Whether they will get it on next year remains a moot and increasingly bitter argument. Meanwhile, instead of a showdown with WBC champion Wilder next month which would have unified that belt with Joshua's WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles, AJ is ticking off a mandatory defence against Russian veteran Alexander Povetkin. That fight will still fill Wembley to its current 90,000 capacity, given Joshua's huge domestic popularity, but it is unlikely to galvanise the world. Thankfully for British boxing, a certain Tyson Fury is willing to gallop to the rescue. The Gypsy King is volunteering to carry the Union Flag out to Las Vegas for a clash of the giants with Wilder which would resonate across both sides of the Atlantic... and beyond. Not least because Wilder is the American wearer of the prime WBC belt, Fury the Mancunian holder of the linear heavyweight crown by virtue of having been first to the dethroning punch against Wladimir Klitschko — and still undefeated. The finalising of that deal depends in part on Fury fulfilling his end of the bargain in the second fight of his comeback, in Belfast on Saturday week, by seeing off Italy's Francesco Pianeta. Confident that he will do so, Fury says: 'I'm going to America to save British boxing from the embarrassment of Joshua not fighting Wilder.' He is also helping Carl Frampton - who tops the bill in Belfast by fighting Luke Jackson - realise his career-long dream of boxing in Northern Ireland's national football stadium, Windsor Park. Come September, the hot nights come thick and fast. Amir Khan continues his comeback against Samuel Vargas in Birmingham on September 8. Later that night in America, Danny Garcia battles Shawn Porter for the vacant WBC world welterweight championship. Khan will be watching keenly and rooting for Garcia, who says he is willing to come to England if he wins and give the Bolton Olympian a chance of avenging a heavy knockout... if the price is right. That would also offer Khan a shot at a third world title which, if he prevailed, would strengthen his bargaining position if ever he and Kell Brook contest a Battle of Britain. September 15 brings the biggest rematch of all. That between superstar middleweights Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin following the scandalous draw decision which robbed Triple G the first time they met in Las Vegas and which was followed by the Mexican idol's positive drugs tests for clenbuterol. Joshua vs Povetkin is on September 22, one weekend before a recovered George Groves goes to Saudi Arabia to put his WBA world super-middleweight title on the line against Callum Smith in what will also be the final of the in inaugural World Super Series tournament for the Ali Trophy. On to October 20 and back to America - probably Vegas - for Billy Joe Saunders defending his WBO middleweight title against the dangerous Demetrius Andrade. Then the tantalising possibility of Wilder v Fury dangles over November. Fasten your ringside seatbelts. Frampton v Jackson and Fury v Pianeta on August 18 will be televised live on BT Sports. Khan v Vargas on September 8 and Joshua v Povetkin on September 22 will be televised live on Sky Sports and Sky Sports Box Office respectively. Groves v Smith on Friday September 28 will be televised live on ITV Box Office  "
"Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City players have set themselves the target of winning every competition they compete in this season, Kyle Walker has revealed. Last season’s record-breaking title-winners will aim for the quadruple of Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League. Their minimum target is to match their 100-point total from 2017-18, and the reigning champions of England are determined to secure as much silverware as possible. ‘To win another trophy with City, it’s a fantastic start to the season,’ said Walker after Sunday’s 2-0 win over Chelsea in the Community Shield. ‘The minimum is to do what we achieved last season. What we achieved was incredible, 100 points. But we have to demand that the bare minimum is last season. We set the bar.  'We set it so high that we have to try to raise it. Everyone in that dressing room is not going to settle for anything less. I know the gaffer wants to win everything he can and so do his players. We are striving to achieve big things this season.’ Last season, City lost in the Champions League quarter-finals to Liverpool and were shocked by Wigan in the FA Cup fifth round. They went on to win the League Cup by beating Arsenal 3-0 in the final. Walker played the full 90 minutes against Chelsea on Sunday, despite only returning to training three days earlier following the World Cup. The 28-year-old cut short his holiday to be back after being given the option by City’s manager. ‘He said you can either come back on August 6 after the Community Shield, or you can come back and compete,’ said Walker. ‘There was no doubt in my mind I wanted to be here.’"
"The RFU are at civil war with some Twickenham grandees who are concerned about the way the body are managing their financial affairs. Former RFU chief executive Francis Baron, credited with building the new Twickenham, has been asked by a group of past RFU presidents to probe where the money has gone. The RFU, despite making a £27million profit from the 2015 World Cup, are currently working through a cash-cutting redundancy programme that will see over 60 personnel lose their jobs. In addition, there is a £30m overspend from the original budget on the East Stand revamp. There is also annoyance that former RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie can retire from Twickenham and then promptly end up as chairman of the Premiership armed with all the RFU secrets. Baron’s findings — which are at draft stage — have already succeeded in causing huge divisions between the RFU’s old guard and the current regime who believe the origin of the upset is something as petty as privileged members losing their automatic seats in the Royal Box. The bad feeling is demonstrated in a message from past president John Owen posted on the Facebook page of Simon Winman, an RFU stalwart whose job is in jeopardy. Owen wrote: ‘It is a travesty that 41 of the 64 redundancies are from the community game. You and others can be assured that serious questions are going to asked about the financial mismanagement of the union affairs over the past six years. Substantial losses appear to have been made year on year and answers are required.’ The RFU strongly deny any suggestion of financial mismanagement, with a spokeswoman saying: ‘We present our detailed business plans to the RFU council every year and our audited financial statements are published annually. ‘We have invited a group of past presidents who have not been on the council for many years in for an update in the next few weeks and also receive regular accurate information. ‘Francis Baron left the union eight years ago and has had no access to the detailed records of the union since his departure, so it is hard to understand what he is basing his views on. ‘We have undergone an extensive financial governance overhaul to ensure that we operate at a standard which is appropriate for an organisation the size of the RFU.’ Ed Smith has hardly put a foot wrong since he became the most left-field choice of all as national selector.  But whether it was a wise move to call a meeting with cricket agent Neil Fairbrother earlier in the season to inform him that his three main clients Joe Root, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes were at the hub of Smith’s selection plans going forward is open to question. TalkSport are replacing Mark Saggers with Natalie Sawyer as presenter of their main Monday to Friday nightly show Kick Off. Saggers, who will continue as host of the Sunday Premier League coverage, has been one of the mainstays on talkSport for over a decade and Sawyer has little radio experience. She left Sky Sports earlier this year having failed to agree a new contract. She wanted more outside broadcast opportunities than Sky were prepared to give her. The shambolically-run Football League’s move to little-known digital network Quest for their highlights programme on Saturday night started in predictable fashion.  Technical problems resulted in a distorted picture on the Freeview platform and a mediocre peak viewing figure of just over 388,000 at the start.  A FL spokesman said: ‘The initial analysis has surpassed early expectations.’ A Quest spokesman said: ‘We have apologised to those fans affected.’ Colin Graves, beleaguered ECB chairman, was expected to talk about the history of Test cricket during his lunchtime speech on the opening day of England’s 1,000th Test at Edgbaston. Instead he went on for ages about his tenure as chairman."
"A day after his Stoke side lost heavily to Leeds, Jack Butland enjoyed a spot of lunch with his fiancee Annabel Peyton amid interest from Chelsea. Butland played the whole 90 minutes for Stoke as they opened their Championship campaign with a disappointing 3-1 loss against Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday. The England international could do nothing to prevent goals from Mateusz Klich, Pablo Hernandez and Liam Cooper, ensuring new boss Gary Rowett started his reign with defeat. With current No 1 Thibaut Courtois failing to show up for training as he looks to force a move to Real Madrid, Butland has emerged as a potential replacement. The England international, capped eight times and part of the 2018 World Cup squad, joined Stoke for £3.3million in 2013 and any move is likely to be a large increase on that fee. Butland proposed to Peyton in May this year, and the pair regularly share snaps of themselves travelling across the world to places including Maui and Las Vegas. The two of them visited Cheshire hot spot Juniper Cafe Bar in Hale Village for a long lunch on Monday afternoon.  "
"Liverpool star Xherdan Shaqiri was spotted out and about donning a flashy £1,200 Gucci jacket on Monday afternoon. The Switzerland international was pictured beaming from ear to ear as he showed off his expensive red and black modern future track jacket, complete with black trousers around Cheshire. Shaqiri took the opportunity to use his day off from Liverpool training to take a trip to the dining hotspot of Cheshire to enjoy a spot of lunch. He was pictured meeting up with friends for a bite to eat at the Village Cafe before taking a stroll around the town.  The winger has made an auspicious start to his Liverpool career and will keen to remain on the same track when Jurgen Klopp's men face Torino on Tuesday. Shaqiri enamoured himself to Liverpool supporters with an outstanding overhead kick against rivals Manchester United during the Reds' pre-season tour of the US.   Shaqiri is likely to feature against Torino and if he does, it will be his first appearance at Anfield since his summer move from Stoke. "
"Leicester are holding talks with Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb over a £13million deal for defender Filip Benkovic. The 21-year-old - who stands at 6ft 4in and has played at centre back for the Croatian champions - has been followed by a number of high-profile clubs including Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund and is considered one of Croatia's brightest prospects. Having made his way through Dinamo Zagreb's youth system, Benkovic made his debut for the senior squad against NK Osijek in July 2015.  Since that debut, Benkovic has been a regular feature in the Croatian top-tier side and that includes playing two terms in the Champions League and one in the Europa League last season. With height being one of his strengths, he is also reported as being quick along the ground as well as showing good ability on the ball. He is yet to make his senior international debut for Croatia - who made their first World Cup final in Russia this summer - but he has made appearances for the Under-19 and Under-21 side. Leicester boss Claude Puel was left with some money to play with after the £60million transfer of Riyad Mahrez to Premier League champions Manchester City earlier this summer.  Rachid Ghezzal became Leicester's fifth new arrival this summer at the King Power Stadium after Jonny Evans, James Maddison, Ricardo Pereira and Danny Ward. The transfer window closes in four days, with the deadline coming at 5pm on Thursday.    "
"Arsenal misfit Lucas Perez is closing in on a £10million move to West Ham, with the forward keen to remain in the Premier League. The 29-year-old joined the Gunners two years ago but spent the entirety of last season on loan at former club Deportivo La Coruna. Having been included in Arsenal's pre-season tour of Singapore it appeared Perez was potentially going to be given a fresh start under new head coach Unai Emery. But a transfer across London to join the Hammers is edging closer as Thursday's deadline approaches, with Perez wanting another chance to make his mark in England. West Ham have already spent big this summer, landing the likes of Felipe Anderson, Issa Diop and Andriy Yarmolenko - as well as bringing in former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere on a free transfer. Perez cost Arsenal a reported £17million in 2016 but made just two Premier League starts under Arsene Wenger as he failed to earn a regular spot at the Emirates Stadium."
"Celtic are poised to fight Fulham moves to snatch central defender Dedryck Boyata. The London club have had a £9million bid to sign the Belgian World Cup star rejected, but are prepared to increase it to £12m as they prepare for life back in the English Premier League.  Celtic have said he is not for sale but Boyata is keen on the move.  Entering the final year of his current deal, Boyata is keen to capitalise on a strong World Cup campaign in Russia after stalling on a new contract with Celtic. However, Sportsmail understands the Parkhead club are highly reluctant to sell the 27-year-old as they prepare for a Champions League third round qualifier with AEK Athens. Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic is expected to step up efforts to land Boyata before the English transfer window closes on Thursday. The club have spent £15m on Swansea defender Alfie Mawson, but he is not likely to be ft until September.  Forced to go with the inexperienced pairing of Jack Hendry and Kristoffer Ajer against Rosenborg, however, the Premiership champions have not yet given up hope of persuading the former Manchester City defender to sign a new deal. Speaking at the launch of Celtic's new third kit yesterday, Norwegian defender Ajer said: 'Dedryck Boyata is a top professional who always keeps fit. 'He was obviously very happy with Belgium's World Cup achievements. It was great for them and it was good to see. 'Dedryck and other experienced centre-halves have helped my development a lot since I broke into the team. 'We played a lot together last season and he was fantastic at communicating with me throughout the games. He's been really helpful. 'So, of course, I would like to see him stay. He's been fantastic at Celtic, which is a club that has a lot of fantastic players. I would like to keep playing beside him and keep learning from him. 'At Celtic, there is competition in every area of the pitch. But that is healthy because it pushes you hard in training every day and you have to be performing well in every game.'  Celtic, meantime, have been handed a favourable chance of reaching the Champions League group stage for a third consecutive season - if they can beat AEK Athens in the third qualifying round. Yesterday's draw for the play-off round paired the winners of Celtic's tie with Swedish side Malmo or Hungarian club MOL Vidi. Malmo currently sit sixth in the Swedish league after 16 games while Vidi sit fifth in the Hungarian league. The draw could have been significantly worse for the Scottish champions, who avoided PSV Eindhoven, Red Star Belgrade, and Dinamo Zagreb as well as the prospect of a nightmare journey to Azerbaijan to face Qarabag or Kazakhstan to take on Astana. "
"Real Madrid have opted for a radical pink colour for their third kit for the new season, with the strip made entirely from recycled ocean plastic. The distinctive outfit will make its debut on Tuesday in Real Madrid's International Champions Cup friendly against Roma. The Champions League winners are not the only club to show their support for the environment this season. Manchester United, Juventus, and Bayern Munich will all have third kits made from the same Parley material recovered from water across the planet. The cost of a men's or women's replica adult shirt is £64.95, while the junior version is priced at £49.95.  Adult shorts are £34.95 and socks £16.95, meaning the full kit will cost £116.85. A complete kids' kit can be purchased for £69.95, with a mini kit at £44.95 If you wish to purchase the authentic Real Madrid shirt, it is priced on the website at £109.95 with matching shorts £42.95.  Madrid will finish their pre-season fixtures against AC Milan at the Barnabeu on Saturday, August 11. Their competitive season begins against city rivals Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup, this year held at Lillekula Stadium in Tallinn, Estonia, on August 15. Four days later the La Liga season begins, with Getafe the first visitors to Madrid on Sunday August 15. Cyrill Gutsch, found of Parley For The Oceans,praised the message behind the kit, which was unveiled in the USA on Monday. He said: 'Real Madrid has the power to amplify our message, to share it with their massive global following and to bring it to life with their own decisions and actions. 'The message is an urgent one. It addresses the survival of four oceans, of four own species.  'It addresses the massive problem of marine plastic pollution. It questions the material itself and defines plastic as a prime example of a toxic substance which we can't afford anymore.'"
"Dejan Lovren returned to training  on Monday to hand manager Jurgen Klopp a boost ahead of the Premier League opener against West Ham on Sunday.  Injuries to Klavan and Matip had left Klopp with only two fit central defenders for the game against Napoli over the weekend, but Lovren's return to the fold gives the German an additional option for Sunday's match. The Croatian was pictured doing fitness work at the club's Melwood training base on his first day back from holiday after the World Cup.   In a video on Liverpool's social media channels, the shaven-headed centre-back could be seen doing squats and stretches in the gym as he began his pre-season fitness work. The 29-year-old could come into contention for Liverpool's final pre-season fixture against Torino on Tuesday, with Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez the only senior centre-backs currently fit and available. Earlier on Monday, Klopp had admitted concerns over his defensive options  as Matip (hip) and Klavan (hamstring) both remain doubtful for the matches against Torino and West Ham.  'Joel (Matip), we'll have to see. Klavan shouldn't be too serious, but if Tuesday is too early I don't know yet,' Klopp told the Liverpool Echo. 'Maybe we will do some magic things with the formation on Tuesday. I don't know how we will do it.' Liverpool have been tipped by many to mount a title challenge this season after splashing the cash in an attempt to close the gap on champions Manchester City. Brazil international Alisson arrived from Roma in a world record £67million deal for a goalkeeper, while Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri have also joined  for a combined £120m. After Sunday's clash with fellow big spenders West Ham, Klopp's side then face Crystal Palace in London on August 20 and Brighton at Anfield five days later."
"Steve Bruce believes Aston Villa will struggle to keep hold of Jack Grealish amid interest from Tottenham. Despite uncertainty over his future, Grealish played 83 minutes in Villa's 3-1 win over Hull on Monday night as the clock ticks down to Thursday's transfer deadline.  But asked about the midfielder's future after the game, Bruce admitted that his star man could still be swayed by the prospect of top-flight football. 'He is a wonderful talent,' Bruce told Sky Sports. 'We will do our best to keep hold of him, but it is going to be difficult. 'We understand the human side. He will want to play in the Premier League, Europe, Champions League.  'Nobody wants him to leave, but there is a human element to it too. The owners have made it pretty clear that they don't want to sell him and that still stands. 'We are all trying our best to hang on to him but at the moment there is no decision to be made as they are not at the figure where the owners are even blinking.' Grealish played a starring role for Villa in the 3-1 win at the KCOM Stadium on Monday. He supplied the corner for Tommy Elphick's equaliser after Evandro had put Hull ahead early on, before second-half goals from Ahmed Elmohamady and Alan Hutton sealed the points. And after being substituted on 83 minutes, Grealish applauded the travelling fans as he left the pitch in what some may see as a potential goodbye. A key performer last season, the England Under-21 man quickly attracted the attention of Premier League clubs with his guile and vision from midfield. Over the weekend, Bruce, though, maintained that Villa are yet to receive any bids for Grealish or fellow team-mates Jonathan Kodjia and James Chester. 'Ten days ago, we couldn't sign a player,' he said. 'Now look at where we are. We've gone from ""everybody is for sale"" within ten days to ""nobody is for sale"". 'If we lost (Jonathan) Kodjia, if we lost (James) Chester, if we lost Grealish, then the team really which got us to the play-off final has been ripped apart in eight weeks. 'It would be mightily difficult so our aim is to keep hold of them. We haven't had any offers, would you believe, for anyone apart from Chester.'"
"Jurgen Klopp has admitted concerns over his defensive options, with Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez the only senior centre backs currently fit and available. The Champions League finalists are due to play Torino in their final pre-season friendly on Tuesday before facing West Ham at home in their Premier League on Sunday. Joel Matip (hip) and Ragnar Klavan (hamstring) missed Saturday's 5-0 thrashing of Italian side Napoli due to injuries and are doubtful for the Torino game at Anfield. 'Joel, we'll have to see. Klavan, shouldn't be too serious, but if Tuesday is too early I don't know yet,' Klopp told the Liverpool Echo.  'Maybe we will do some magic things with the formation on Tuesday. I don't know how we will do it.' Croatia international Dejan Lovren will rejoin the squad on Monday after an extended break following the World Cup but is a doubt for the next two games. 'Dejan didn't train so far. He probably won't play Tuesday and Sunday will be very difficult as well,' Klopp added.  'The first two league games at least are in the 'pre-season' (for the World Cup players).' Liverpool finished fourth last season but enjoyed a fabulous run in the Champions League, making it to the final where they lost 3-1 to Real Madrid and in the process smashed the goal-scoring record of European football's elite competition. 'The league will be difficult,' Klopp continued. 'It is not about judging our situation and thinking 'wow, really good'. 'We need to be ready each week, not only for a few games. That is our challenge.'   The transfer window has been kind to Klopp as the new season approaches, with the arrival of midfielders Naby Keita and Fabinho, while playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Stoke and goalkeeper Alisson signed from Roma in a world-record deal. "
"Huddersfield Town are in talks over a proposed £13.5million deal for Belgian winger Isaac Mbenza. The French-born 22-year-old plays for Montpellier and scored ten goals last season.  He can play across the front line but favours the right wing, which is where he will likely be needed at the Kirklees Stadium. David Wagner has been looking to strengthen his wide options all summer and his need has been greater since offloading Tom Ince to Stoke City for £12m. The Terriers have been busy in the transfer market following their close call with relegation last season and have signed Adama Diakhaby, Terence Kongolo, Ramadan Sobhi, Juninho Bacuna, Erik Durm and Ben Hamer already.  Meanwhile, QPR are showing interest in Huddersfield's German centre-back Michael Hefele."
"If this was to be Jack Grealish's last performance in a Villa shirt, he certainly used it to showcase his considerable talents as he helped his club put their summer upheavals behind them. The £40 million-rated playmaker helped turn the game after Steve Bruce's side fell behind to a seventh minute Hull opener. And even though it was a pair of unlikely heroes - Ahmed Elmohamady and Alan Hutton - who netted the decisive second half goals, Grealish demonstrated why Tottenham are so keen to land him before Thursday's transfer deadline. Hull (4-2-3-1):  Marshall; Lichaj, De Wijs, Burke, Kingsley; Batty, Henriksen; Bowen, Kane (Milinkovic 67), Evandro (Keane 86); Campbell (Dicko 67) Subs not used Stewart, Long, MacDonald, Irvine Scorer: Evadro 7  Aston Villa (4-1-4-1): Steer; Chester, Elphick, Hutton, Elmohamady; Whelan, Hourihane, Taylor, Grealish (Bjarnason 83), Adomah (Green 67); Kodjia (Hepburn-Murphy 77) Subs not used: Lansbury, Bree,  Gardner, Bunn Scorer:  Elphick 14, Elmohamady 70, Hutton 75  Referee:  Andy Madley At one stage this summer, with Villa reeling financially after losing in the play-off final in May, his departure looked a certainty. But Villa's new billionaire owners insist he does not have to leave and that is music to the ears of the visiting supporters who chanted 'We want you to stay' as he was subbed 10 minutes from time. 'You can't replace him, it's as simple as that,' said Bruce. 'We understand the human side of him. He wants to play in the Premier League, in Europe, in the Champions League. It's all natural. 'But he's an Aston Villa fan, his family are Aston Villa through and through - they were probably in the away end tonight - so it's an emotional thing for him but he's young and ambitious. 'I'm sure it will be a fraught two or three days before the window closes but the owners have been clear they want him to stay and that's what we will try and do. 'And at the moment there is no decision to be made because the figures that are being talked about, the owners aren't even blinking.' Hull actually enjoyed a dominant spell either side of the break, with the game locked at 1-1, until Grealish, socks round ankles like a throwback from the seventies, began to pod and probe, putting Hull's defence under increasing pressure. Finally, on 70 minutes, keeper David Marshall cracked, with a poor clearance straight to former Hull favourite Elmohamady upfield. The Egyptian international - who spent five years at Hull, four under Bruce - swapped passes with Conor Hourihane before advancing and beating Marshall with a crisp 15 yard shot. Five minutes later, the game was over and so was Villa's uncertain and depressing summer. Cult favourite Alan Hutton collected the ball 30 yards out and slalomed upfield, twisting through four defenders, before coolly slotting in his first goal since December 2014.  'Once you get back onto the field it's certainly more straightforward,' said Bruce. 'The players have gone out there tonight and just got on with their job. 'It's been a difficult period for everybody, we've had people at the club lose their jobs, there have been cuts here, there and everywhere. 'When that happens it's disappointing but what has happened the last couple off weeks has been fantastic for the club.' It looked like the double whammy of May's play-off final loss to Fulham and near financial ruin was still providing a hangover for Villa as they fell behind after just seven minutes. It was a goal that frustrated Bruce as his goalkeeper Jed Steer appeared to have cleared a free-kick with a solid punch to the edge of the Villa box. But Brazilian Evandro was in space and lofted in a hopeful high ball which looped over defender Tommy Elphick's desperate goalline attempt to clear and nestled in the Villa goal. Here was the first real test of the new season - after all the tests of the last campaign and the summer - and Villa took just seven minutes to respond. Grealish delivered a quite magnificent left-wing corner and Elphick rose athletically, soaring above Jordy de Wijs and heading in the equaliser."
"Danny Rose has thanked the football world for their support after opening up about suffering with depression. Rose talked about dealing with mental illness before England flew to the World Cup in Russia at the start of the summer. For the first time he has spoken about how he reacted after news of his situation broke. 'I remember we played at Leeds - England against Costa Rica before the World Cup,' Rose told the Daily Mirror. 'I remember waking up that morning, the morning after it came out. I woke up to a lot of messages and I got really upset. I wasn't expecting it. I wasn't expecting the amount of messages that I got.'  Rose played the full match against Costa Rica at Elland Road. He said that England manager Gareth Southgate spoke to him before the game.   'We had a walk around the hotel and, again, he gave me some really nice words. It was a funny few days for me,' Rose said. 'Then that night we played against Costa Rica and after the game the manager said that it was one of the best games he'd seen me play. It was as though I'd got a lot of things off my chest.' Rose is currently preparing for the new Premier League season with Tottenham. But at the weekend he went along to Blundell Park to support his brother Mitch who plays for Grimsby Town. He was struck by how supportive people have been to him and the only regret he has is that he didn't tell his story sooner. He added: 'I was back home in Doncaster over the weekend,' Rose said. 'My brother plays for Grimsby and I was at the game (against Forest Green).  'I had two people come up to me at the game thanking me for what I'd said. It just made me wish maybe I'd done it sooner. Or maybe after the World Cup, but yes, I'm glad I did it in the end.'"
"Cardiff City have expressed an interest in signing former Manchester City and Middlesbrough striker Alvaro Negredo.  The Spaniard is valued at £3million by his club Besiktas and Cardiff boss Neil Warnock is desperate to bring in a striker before Thursday afternoon's deadline. After Saturday's 2-1 friendly defeat by Real Betis, Warnock was asked if he was lining up a striker. He said: 'Yes I think so. We didn't play with one today and I thought we did alright. 'We had two smaller lads and I thought we played quite well doing that. We had a bit more threat and movement so who knows.' Negredo spent two years in the Premier League with Manchester City from 2013 and 2015 before a loan move to Middlesbrough a year later. The 32-year-old scored nine goals in 32 appearances at the Etihad Stadium and managed a further nine goals in 36 games for Boro."
"Forward Saido Berahino is eligible to play for Burundi in next month's Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after FIFA approved his application to switch international allegiance, the country's football federation said on Monday. The 25-year-old former England Under 21 international had applied for the change as his chances of winning a full England cap receded.  He had previously turned down approaches from Burundi. The Stoke City player could debut next month for the country of his birth, which he fled as a 10-year-old with his mother and siblings.  He was granted political asylum in Britain in the wake of the ethnic conflict in the small east African country.  FIFA allow players to switch allegiance as long as they have not played a competitive senior international and have the nationality of the country they want to represent. Burundi visit Gabon next month in their second Nations Cup qualifier in Group C, having started their campaign to reach the 2019 finals with a 3-0 home win over South Sudan. Burundi are currently top of their Africa Cup of Nations group."
"Ross Barkley warned patience will be required as Maurizio Sarri sets about his transformation of Chelsea. Sarri was appointed three weeks ago after Antonio Conte was sacked as head coach and Chelsea were well beaten by Manchester City in Sunday's Community Shield at Wembley. 'If you look back to now in three months, you'll see a big difference,' Barkley said. 'You've just got to be a patient with getting to know the new manager's way.' Barkley hopes to secure a place in Sarri's side and earn an England recall. The 24-year-old moved to Stamford Bridge from Everton in January, but injuries limited his impact. Now fully fit and encouraged by Sarri's warm praise of his attributes, Barkley is eager to play a big role for club and country. 'The (England) team did really well and the team's going far,' Barkley said. 'You can see the direction the team's going in. Hopefully the performances that I put in early on I can get back in the squad. That's my aim, but to be doing well for Chelsea is first thing.' Barkley played his first 90 minutes in over a year on Sunday. He is optimistic of a strong campaign, which begins with Saturday's Premier League opener at Huddersfield. 'It's a big season for me,' he added. 'I had a few injuries and I signed off of a long-term injury. But that's behind me now. I'm feeling really strong now and I'm sure when the season starts next week I'll be ready to go.'"
"Manchester City have returned to training less than 24 hours after their Community Shield win over Chelsea on Sunday afternoon.  Following his man of the match performance, Sergio Aguero was ready to turn his attention back to the start of the Premier League season as he trained with his team-mates on Monday afternoon. Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne also returned to training ahead of the new campaign as they look to get back their match fitness following long breaks after the World Cup.  John Stones and Kyle Walker were among a few names to cut their post-World Cup holidays short in a bid to be ready for Sunday's opening game at the Emirates.  While City's title defence begins against Arsenal, Ilkay Gundogan was pleased with how his side fared against Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea side. 'I was curious the way we would start the game and how it would go,' Gundogan told mancity.com. 'We knew what to expect and we knew it was going to be really tough. 'We did a great job. It was a very good start to the season for us. All in all it was a great performance and a well deserved win. 'I wouldn't say that it was necessary to give us confidence, but the first weeks when the season starts, the important games start, you never really know what to expect. You don't really know 100 per cent on which level you are. 'It was a great test for us, a last test before the Premier League season. At the end we feel ready right now and we can't wait for the season to start.'"
"Romelu Lukaku returned to Manchester United training for the first time  on Monday after being given a lengthy break following his World Cup campaign with Belgium. The striker was pictured driving into Carrington as he linked back up with Jose Mourinho's squad for a pre-season training session. Lukaku was afforded extra time off by United after his country Belgium's run to third place at the 2018 World Cup this summer in Russia.  Also pulling into United's training ground on Monday was midfielder Nemanja Matic, who offered a thumbs up ahead of the Red Devils' pre-season training session. He was joined by the likes of Marcus Rashford, Phil Jones and Sergio Romero as United players began gearing up for the start of the Premier League season.  United take part in the 2018-19 Premier League curtain-raiser on Friday night when they host Leicester at Old Trafford in the first match of the new season.  Last season's runners-up lost 1-0 to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich in Germany on Sunday to round off a disappointing pre-season.  Aside from poor results on the pitch, manager Mourinho has caused controversy off it as he appears at loggerheads with chief executive Ed Woodward over a lack of new signings so far this summer.  Fred, Diogo Dalot and goalkeeper Lee Grant are the only new arrivals at Old Trafford so far and Mourinho is desperate for new recruits ahead of Thursday's deadline.  Speaking after Sunday's game, Mourinho welcomed the end of pre-season and hailed the performance of his young players in the absence of the more established stars who were away on their post-World Cup holidays.  'Finally, it's over. Finally, such a difficult pre-season is over,' Mourinho told the club's website after the match at the Allianz Arena. 'The players were, once more, brilliant. They could not have done better than what they did. (It was a) fantastic experience for the boys. 'There was a moment I was looking to the area and there was Axel (Tuanzebe) at centre-back to left, Demetri (Mitchell) at left wing-back, (James) Garner in midfield on the left and (Tahith) Chong. 'It was fantastic, absolutely fantastic. We were playing against their best team, it was their complete squad apart from (Corentin) Tolisso.' United are currently in discussions with Bayern over a deal for centre back Jerome Boateng with former target Yerry Mina set to join Everton from Barcelona.  Bayern manager Niko Kovac revealed there was 'nothing new' regarding the deal as Boateng trained with his team-mates as normal on Monday.  "
"Nabil Fekir has refused to rule out a last-minute move to Liverpool this summer despite insisting he is happy at Lyon. L'Equipe reported on Monday morning that Lyon would still allow the French World Cup winner to leave this summer if a suitable offer comes in, said to be around the £60million mark.  Fekir, who returned to Lyon training this week, is however keeping his cards close to his chest and is yet to make a commitment on his future amid rumours Liverpool are ready to table an offer before the English transfer window slams shut this week. Scroll down for video.  'As you can see, I am in Lyon. I am very good here. But the transfer window is still long and everything goes very fast in football,' he told OLTV. 'We do not know what will happen in the future but I am very good here. I feel great in the group. We have very good players, there is a good atmosphere. 'It's a bit like the French team: there is a mix between young and old, with more experienced players than others.  'There is a good group, very homogeneous. We live well and I hope that Lyon will have a great season.' Fekir returned to training for the first time on Monday after featuring in the France squad which beat Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 World Cup final   One of the clips shows the striker being hugged and shaking hands with fellow players in the dressing room.  The tweet is captioned: 'Return of the captain, Nabil Fekir in the locker room!  #Family' - which indicates that Lyon feel their man is set to stay.  Subsequent videos show him going through light drills and training exercises to get the forward back up to speed.  Fekir had seemed destined to join Liverpool earlier this summer, only for Lyon to pull the plug at the very last moment.  While Liverpool have already been very active in the transfer market, signing the likes of Alisson and Fabinho, they remain in the market for another striker.  "
"Rangers are expected to secure the £2million signing of Croatian international left-back Borna Barisic on Tuesday as Steven Gerrard continues his recruitment drive. The Ibrox club, who have lodged an appeal against the red card shown to Alfredo Morelos in Sunday's controversial 1-1 draw against Aberdeen, have moved swiftly after Barisic impressed as Osijek captain in their recent Europa League clashes. The 25-year-old scored with a deflected strike at Ibrox last Thursday evening and was his side's stand-out performer across the two legs of a 2-1 aggregate defeat. Barisic was in Glasgow on Monday afternoon and will conclude contract formalities providing there are no issues with his medical. He was part of Croatia's preliminary 32-man squad for the World Cup but missed out on a spot in the final selection. The ex-Dinamo Zagreb player is poised to become Gerrard's 11th summer addition, with the prospect of a 12th later this week as Rangers remain keen to conclude a loan deal for young Bournemouth centre-back Jake Simpson. Speaking at the weekend, Barisic admitted he would love to play at Ibrox on a regular basis. 'The atmosphere was incredible and I was hugely impressed, he said. 'I think when you watch it on TV, it doesn't prepare you for what the noise is actually like. Who would not like to play every week in such an atmosphere? I'd love to play at Ibrox in every game.'  The Croatian would rival Jon Flanagan for a starting left-back role in Gerrard's plans and could signal an exit for both Declan John and former club captain Lee Wallace. Swansea are among the clubs interested in taking Welsh international John on loan. Meanwhile, Rangers are contesting the dismissal of Morelos for kicking out at Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna. The Colombian defender was sent off by referee Kevin Clancy after just 12 minutes, with Gerrard insisting they felt 'hard done by' because Morelos was provoked by 'two violent barges' from McKenna. Rangers have now lodged their appeal at the SFA, with a hearing to take place later this week. Should they fail to have it overturned, Morelos would be facing a two-match ban, ruling him out of Sunday's Premiership clash with St Mirren as well as their Betfred Cup clash at Kilmarnock on August 19. Ibrox midfielder Ryan Jack was taken to hospital on Sunday after suffering a head injury when clattered in a challenge by Stevie May at Pittodrie. Sportsmail understands he was later released by medics but, given the nature of the knock, it remains to be seen whether he is available for Thursday's Europa League first leg against Maribor."
"Real Madrid have identified Miralem Pjanic as a top target should Luka Modric move to Inter Milan this summer. The Serie A club have their sights set on acquiring the Croatian midfielder, who is open to the move according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.  Reports in Italy have suggested Inter Milan have prepared a bumper annual salary of £10million for the player but new manager Julen Lopetegui is adamant that he is going nowhere. However, the Spanish club have plans in place should the move go through. Pjanic is the man Madrid believe can replace Modric but Juventus will be unwilling to sell for any less than £90million. The Italian champions would then attempt to sign Lazio's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to fill the gap left by Pjanic.  Madrid president Florentino Perez has made it clear the club have no plans to lose Modric, however, saying only an outlandish bid of £660m would be enough. 'The president has already given an answer, I don't have much else to add,' Lopetegui said following Madrid's victory over Juve on Saturday. 'Modric is an extraordinary player, we await him with open arms. I talked to him after his excellent World Cup and we'll see if he can play on August 15 (against Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup), our first big objective of the season. 'I told him he was a player I'm passionate about, I love him and he knows it. He'll be happy with the proposal he receives here. 'He'll be happy to play football, like he already was, at Real Madrid. Luka is a Madrid player and will continue to be, I have no doubt. We've enjoyed having him and we'll continue to do so.'"
"Georgia Hall was fast asleep at 1am when she received a congratulatory message from another Lytham Open winner, Tom Lehman. The American thought she’d still be out celebrating but the sweet, sensible plasterer’s daughter doesn’t really do plastered. Besides, the young need their beauty sleep. Here’s one startling statistic that not only underlines the magnitude of Hall’s achievement in winning the British Open on Sunday, but how young she actually is.   Not since the Scot Willie Anderson emigrated from North Berwick and won the US Open in 1901 has any British golfer won a major at an age as tender as 22. There was also the fact she knew she had an alarm call at 5.30am for a round of interviews, as the nation learned more about the heartening story of the working-class girl who plastered her name all over the papers on Monday. It really doesn’t get much better, a mirror image of the Tommy Fleetwood tale, in fact. Two kids who grew up in households where money was tight, but who have prospered on the strength of their talent, ice-cool temperament and level-headedness. Ask Hall whether she plans to treat herself after landing a £390,000 jackpot, and she gives a Fleetwood-esque response. ‘I’ve not really thought about it, but I don’t think so,’ she told Sportsmail. ‘I have everything I need. I’ll probably treat my brother and sister.’ Here is Hall’s idea of a treat. Asked on Friday how she planned to spend time before her third round, she replied: ‘I think I’ll have my nails done.’ There weren’t many nails left unbitten around Lytham on Sunday, where Hall and her dad Wayne, who was her caddie, were two of the few to remain calm. Dad was under strict instructions not to show any emotion. ‘I learned a long time ago that if I get too excited I start hitting bad shots,’ said Georgia. ‘I wanted to keep my thoughts to myself and not get involved with the crowd.’ She couldn’t help it down the last, with the title all but won. Britain doesn’t produce many major winners but Tony Jacklin, Catriona Matthew and now Georgia have enjoyed that resplendent scene at Lytham. ‘I don’t think it’s a coincidence,’ said Hall. ‘It’s just a classic golf area, the fans really get into it, and I’m so appreciative of all the support I got.’ More than 16,000 people, indeed, showed up on the final day as Hall carried out her Lehman blueprint. ‘I played golf with him a couple of weeks ago and he told me to play short of the bunkers, and make it a longer golf course,’ she said. ‘He said it was far better to play from the fairways even if the shots were longer, and his advice proved invaluable. The fact I only went in one fairway bunker all week was one of the keys to my win.’ As was her wondrous putting. ‘I think it might have been the best putting display I’ve ever seen,’ said Ken Brown, who was a heck of a putter himself. Hall’s victory wasn’t all down to talent and clear thinking. There was, apparently, a bit of magic involved. For such a brilliant, uncluttered golfing mind, Hall’s list of superstitions makes bizarre reading.  Dad wasn’t allowed to change his socks, for example. Boyfriend Harry Tyrrell had to draw the curtains each night and switch out the light. Before every round, Hall had to touch each club and count them. Finally, she always — always — has to hole a 6ft putt before marching to the first tee. Harry, who is usually her caddie, and Georgia drove to Scotland on Monday afternoon, where she will partner Laura Davies at the multi-sports European Championships, where the golf team event starts tomorrow. It finally gave her a chance to catch up on all the congratulatory messages, from the likes of Lehman, Justin Rose, Luke Donald and Annika Sorenstam. There was also a tweet from Sir Nick Faldo, who shot a final round 67 in the 1996 Masters in Georgia to defeat Greg Norman.  Now, the girl named in honour of that success has a 67 of her own in the final round of a major to cherish; one that, like Faldo’s, will enter the annals as one of the greatest ever played by a British golfer. QUOTE OF THE WEEK ‘There will have been lots of boys and girls watching on television seeing a young girl at the top of her game. Hopefully, they’re going to say to their parents that they want a set of golf clubs.’ Dame Laura Davies, the grand matriarch of the women’s game, on her hopes that Georgia Hall’s sensational victory will prove inspirational. Bellerive and the day the world changed No one who was at Bellerive, St Louis, the last time they tried to stage a top tournament will forget it. On Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001, Tiger Woods had just finished a practice round for that week’s WGC event when he was approached by an official. ‘By the time we got in the clubhouse, unfortunately, we had the chance to see the second plane hit,’ said Woods, of the terrorist attack on New York’s World Trade Center. I was halfway across the Atlantic when the pilot made the sort of announcement that really does chill the blood. ‘I need everyone to take their seats as I’ve a very important announcement,’ he said, before telling us what had happened, followed by the news we’d be heading for Canada. Back at Bellerive and it soon became clear there would be no tournament. Tiger drove 1,200 miles home to Florida, where no one recognised him when he stopped. ‘I think for everyone life had just become a blur,’ he said. A month later, the Ryder Cup was cancelled, and the golf calendar changed for ever when it moved to even-numbered years. Bellerive, the venue for this week’s 100th USPGA Championship, will mark another change, for this will be the last PGA staged in August, before it moves to May."
"It is rather charming that in the stadium where Jesse Owens ran Olympic rings around the Nazis and Usain Bolt did the very best of his work, Reece Prescod really wouldn’t mind if a Volkswagen Beetle served as the legacy of his trip to Berlin. It is the car his mother has been eyeing for a while and the one he wants to buy for her if the medal bonuses start coming in. With that in mind, she might be able to pick a colour as early as Tuesday evening, when he goes for 100 metres gold on the opening night of the European Championships. Bookmakers price him at around 5-1, below Britain’s Zharnel Hughes and France’s Jimmy Vicaut, who together rank as the fastest men in Europe this year at 9.91sec. That could be a costly oversight. On the surface, his times make the bookies about right, with a personal best of 10.03sec ranking him only sixth among Britain’s current sprinters. A far more accurate gauge of his talent is the wind-assisted 9.88sec run he delivered in the US earlier in the summer. Had the wind been a shade less and his time allowed to stand, he would sit just 0.01sec off Linford Christie, the British record holder, and it is with some justification that figures in athletics think that 25-year-old 9.87sec mark could finally fall. The forecasted temperature in the high 20s to early 30s would be just about perfect for records, and so long as the wind is favourable, Christie’s record could be more vulnerable than ever. Hughes is also capable of breaking it after a superb season in which he was disqualified from a Commonwealth Games gold in the 200m for a lane infringement. CJ Ujah, 2017 Diamond League series champion, is the third Brit in the 100m and a one-two-three, while unlikely with Vicaut in the field, is not beyond possibility. That is testament to the unprecedented depth in British sprinting, but it is Prescod who the world-leading American talents view as the longer-term threat. It is also Prescod who struck the most confident notes coming in.  Before the year’s biggest meet he said: ‘I don’t wake up to be the best in Europe — what drives me to train is to be world champion, to be the best.’ Strong words followed by a reference to this summer’s British Championships, when Hughes was installed by many as a favourite after his 9.91sec, only to be beaten by Prescod for a second straight national title. ‘I’ve only really lost to guys on the world stage,’ said Prescod. ‘People forget that. They say, “Oh yeah, he’s not the favourite any more”. People remember me then forget me. I’m getting used to it.’ He added: ‘Zharnel is running well. He’s run 9.9 this year, which is good. I haven’t legally run that, but at the same time I’ve looked at the performances prior to the British Championships and on paper you could say he was going to win. ‘But it came down to the day and the result was different.’ When asked how he would celebrate if he won here, Prescod said: ‘I come from a single-parent family and so as long as my mum’s good, that’s my priority. She has bills to pay and I’ve got to help so as much as I would love to live a footballer glamorous life, I’ve got real life to deal with. ‘She doesn’t have a car at the moment, but she does want a new car. I’ve also got little sisters and they like Disneyland so I want to do things like that.’ From a British perspective, Prescod’s meeting with Hughes on Tuesday night could be the showdown of the Championships. Also on Tuesday, Dina Asher-Smith will start favourite in the 100m in the first of two duels with double world champion Dafne Schippers, who she will also face in the 200m. With a relay at the weekend, she is chasing a hat-trick at the end of a season in which she lowered her own 100m British record. Along with the male sprinters, Asher-Smith could take this 101-strong team well on the way towards their UK Sport medal target, which Sportsmail understands has been set at between 12 and 16. They should reach it comfortably, but will need an upturn in fortunes after captain Dai Greene withdrew from the 400m hurdles on Monday night with a hamstring problem - the latest setback in a long line of injuries for the 32-year-old."
"Chris Ashton is still the winger with the best try-scoring record in England, but amazingly it is four years since he played for his country. Now 31, Ashton knew he would never play for England again while he continued to ply his trade with Toulon in the south of France. So, with the 2019 Rugby World Cup on the horizon, he realised it was time to have one final go at persuading England coach Eddie Jones to bring him back. It all began to change at Twickenham in May. Ashton was selected for a stellar Barbarians side to face England. After an encouraging chat with Jones before kick-off, Ashton ran riot, crossing for a hat-trick within 25 minutes. He then negotiated an early release from his Toulon contract, believed to be worth £700,000 a year, to join Sale Sharks. Within weeks, Jones called Ashton into an England training squad. ‘Having played abroad in France maybe brought the best out of me in terms of my rugby and I still felt I had a lot to offer,’ said Ashton. ‘I didn’t want the opportunity of giving myself a chance of being involved with England with a World Cup around the corner to go amiss.’ Ashton’s recall to England’s squad last week was relatively low-key. There was no phone call from Jones. No heads-up. Ashton simply received a phone notification last Thursday that he had been added to a WhatsApp group for England’s three-day training camp in Teddington over the weekend. ‘I was going to move house on Saturday,’ he said. ‘Thankfully, I moved it to Friday so I could get here. I had no idea it was coming. I am grateful of the opportunity to come back in. ‘It’s a step in the right direction. Every conversation with Eddie, and being around a team that has been so successful over the last couple of years, is a bonus.’ Ashton was a real force between 2010 and 2014, scoring 19 tries in 39 Tests and being dubbed ‘Ash the Splash’ before his England career went into freefall. He was left out of Stuart Lancaster’s 2015 World Cup squad while bans for eye-gouging and biting derailed his hopes of a recall under Jones.  Fed up and feeling unwanted, he swapped Saracens for a fresh start with Toulon at the end of the 2017 season, where he flourished at full back and finished the campaign with a record 24 Top 14 tries.  No mean feat when you consider the talent that has graced the French league through the years: Rougerie, Clerc, Sivivatu and Heymans, to name but a few. ‘It’s a different culture and I am a better person and player for experiencing it,’ he said. ‘I loved the match days. Playing at home in Toulon is one of a kind and you don’t get it anywhere in Europe.’ The rugby league convert admits he would have spent the next five or six years playing with Toulon’s galacticos but for homesickness and unfulfilled England ambitions. But for Wigan-born Ashton, his wife, Melissa, and their toddler daughter Ava Grace, the north of England was calling. ‘We both have big families and going out to France with a young baby and looking to have more babies, we found it harder than we anticipated,’ he said. ‘Although Toulon is not far away, it felt far away at times. We feel more settled back in England.’ "
"Katie Archibald could not mask her disappointment after winning silver in the women’s cycling omnium on Monday night at the 2018 European Championships. Having already won gold in the team pursuit and finishing second in the individual pursuit, Archibald ended up 12 points behind Dutch world champion Kirsten Wild in the omnium. But Archibald, 24, was not happy after the final race in Glasgow. ‘I’m a bit dejected,’ she admitted. ‘I didn’t have it. Once I realised I didn’t have it, I switched off. It was just a bit of a non-race as it became unachievable.’ Meanwhile, British swimmer Adam Peaty won another gold. The 23-year-old was a member of the 4x100m mixed medley relay team that stormed to victory in the pool. The quartet of Peaty, Georgia Davies, Freya Anderson and James Guy set a new European record for the event, coming home in 3min 40.18sec. Their gold was the fourth medal of the evening for Team GB, with James Wilby winning silver in a very tight 200m breaststroke and Alys Thomas and Max Litchfield both taking bronze in the 200m butterfly and 200m individual medley respectively."
"Tottenham supporters have been given their first experience of the club's new stadium as the club opened their doors for an orientation day. Fans were welcomed into the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as Spurs offered their supporters a matchday experience, only without the football itself. Workers at the new ground were shown how the stadium would run as staff members were pictured manning food kiosks inside the ground.  Supporters strolled around the stadium on Saturday as they took in their new surroundings ahead of the first match there - due to be against Liverpool on September 15.    Tottenham will play their first official home game of the campaign, against newly-promoted Fulham, at Wembley while work is completed on their new ground. The run means Tottenham's first four matches - including games against Newcastle, Manchester United and Watford - will all  be away from their new home. The club recently posted pictures showing off the stadium in the sunlight and of the retractable NFL pitch, which will host regular season American football matches starting from mid-October.  The ground has been named the 'Tottenham Hotspur Stadium' and will form part of the promotion of their own brand with the 'A' in the word 'stadium' stylised to create an arrow pointing up to represent the club's north London location.   While the club will boast a new ground this season, the team have yet to make any new additions to the squad during the summer transfer window.  Burnley completed the purchase of Ben Gibson from Middlesbrough on Sunday meaning Tottenham are the only top-flight club yet to make a summer signing.  Tottenham's second-string were defeated 4-1 by Girona on Saturday, emphasising the need for new reinforcements ahead of the 2018-19 campaign.  "
"Monday mornings are tough at the best of times but for Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire there was also a physically demanding first training session back at Leicester City. The pair concluded their post-World Cup holidays recently, having played their part in England's impressive run to the semi-finals. But with the Foxes opening the 2018-19 season on Friday away to Manchester United, the duo have plenty of catching up to do in terms of match fitness and manager Claude Puel last week all but ruled them out of the opener.  Maguire, a key target for United boss Jose Mourinho, looked to have the edge on Vardy during an arms exercise on the metal bars. The central defender's stock has soared following a number of impressive performances for England this summer and Leicester boss Puel will be hoping he is still a Foxes player come the end of the window on Thursday. Training away from the main group having just returned from holiday, both players were shown exactly what was expected of them with coaches using laptops to get their messages across.  Both players were crucial to the team last season but boss Puel knows the limited training time compared to the rest of the group means they are highly unlikely to get minutes at Old Trafford. 'If we are serious I think they cannot participate in the first game, with just five days training with the team,' Puel told reporters recently. 'They normally need more time, but we will see together with calm. 'We don't rush these players. It is important after the World Cup to work but also come back with the team and live with the team to find again the atmosphere of the club and the squad. 'Of course Jamie and Harry are valuable players for us but we need to protect them. If they are available to play in their minds it is a good thing... but we have to take a protective decision from us.'"
"Axel Witsel is back in Europe after leaving Chinese Super League club Tianjin Quanjian for Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund.  The 29-year-old Belgium international midfielder joined up with the Dortmund pre-season training camp in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland, on Monday afternoon.  Witsel joins Dortmund after they activated his release clause, believed to be £20million, to bring him to Germany. Scroll down for video. 'After the World Cup, it was my goal to move from China back to Europe,' he told the club website. 'I'm totally happy and also proud to join Dortmund. After our first conversation, I did not have to think twice, because for me Dortmund is one of the best clubs on the continent. I cannot wait to play in front of 81,000 people.' The big-haired midfielder impressed this summer at the World Cup, where Belgium finished a best ever third place.  This caught the attention of major European clubs, and Witsel is back on the continent after agreeing a four-year contract with Dortmund.  Witsel, who has 96 international caps, left Zenit Saint Petersburg for China in 2017, having started his career at Standard Liege and spent a year with Benfica. However after a season with Tianjin, where he played 35 matches and scored five goals, he has decided to leave Asian football.   Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said: 'For many months we have been keen to sign Axel Witsel and we are very happy that he has chosen us. 'Axel is a player with a great deal of international experience who has all the skills to shape the central midfield: tactical understanding, tackling power, speed, creativity and mentality. "
"West Ham, Newcastle and Leicester are all in negotiations with Juventus over their midfielder Stefano Sturaro.   The Italian champions are looking to offload Sturaro this summer in a bid to try and balance the books after the £100million arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. The midfielder is one of several players who has been made surplus to requirements ahead of the new Serie A campaign and is available for around £18m. Fiorentina, Genoa and Frankfurt were the favourite early runners to sign Sturaro, but have all since pulled out due to Juve's high valuation of the player. According to calciomercato, the Premier League is now Sturaro's likeliest destination with three clubs pursuing him. West Ham, Newcastle and Leicester have all expressed concrete interest and have made contact with Juventus, though no official offer has been submitted yet. The Hammers have held a long-standing interest in the 25-year-old and are understood to be the player's preferred suitors. Despite the English transfer window closing in four days' time, Juve remain confident of striking a deal to sell Sturaro before the deadline."
"Jose Mourinho has warned Manchester United face a 'difficult season' if they do not strengthen their squad before the transfer window shuts on Thursday. United's build-up to the new campaign has been dominated by Mourinho's clear frustration over transfers, which has brought his relationship with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward into the spotlight. The only arrivals into Old Trafford this summer have been Brazilian midfielder Fred, teenage full-back Diogo Dalot and back-up goalkeeper Lee Grant, leaving Mourinho to cast envious glances at how his rivals are shaping up for the new Premier League season.  The Portuguese told MUTV ahead of his side's pre-season friendly defeat to Bayern Munich: 'My CEO knows what I want and I still have a few days to wait and see what happens. 'The other clubs who compete with us are really strong and already have fantastic teams. Or they are investing massively like Liverpool, who are buying everything and everybody. 'If we don't make our team better it will be a difficult season for us.' Mourinho and Woodward have been urged to put their heads together and bring the good times back to United by the club's former chief executive Peter Kenyon. Kenyon was a key figure at United during the glory years of Sir Alex Ferguson and has watched from a distance as the Red Devils have struggled to land the league title for the past five years.    Kenyon acknowledges things have yet to click two years into the Portuguese's reign but does believe it can happen. 'They have to work it out and they'll find a way of working it out,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek. 'United is bigger than anybody, bigger than any individual and that's always been the mantra. 'It will get worked out and I would hope Jose is part of that working it out because he is incredibly skilled and he's demonstrated he can do things. 'He is more than capable, one of the best coaches in the world but have they got it right? No. 'I think the first people to recognise that will be the people at United. 'Jose has all the capabilities, he's done it, but I don't think he's in a place where he feels good at the moment, or United feel good at the moment or the fans at the moment.'  "
"Manchester United may have endured a difficult pre-season campaign in many respects, but the performances of one new signing have at least gone some way to lifting a bit of that gloom. United parted with £52million in June to make Frederico Rodrigues de Paula Santos - better known as Fred - their most high-profile summer recruit to date and the former Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder has wasted little time in making a positive impression. After returning from the World Cup, where he did not play a single minute for quarter-finalists Brazil, Fred made his first appearance for United in a heavy 4-1 defeat to rivals Liverpool last month before starting in the final United States tour match against Real Madrid. He impressed primarily with his composure in possession and passing vision during that 2-1 victory in Miami and retained his place for Sunday's clash with Bayern Munich, playing 79 minutes as a youthful side were beaten 1-0 at the Allianz Arena.  Fred once again received plenty of plaudits throughout that tie settled by Javi Martinez's second-half header and his displays throughout the last few weeks - coupled with the encouraging form of Andreas Pereira and imminent return of Paul Pogba - have led fans to dream of a midfield to one day potentially rival any in Europe. 'So, so clean on the ball. Fred is going to be some player for us,' said one supporter during the defeat to Bayern. Last week, another stated: 'Fred, Pereira and Pogba could be the best midfield trio in Europe.'  Fred looks likely to make his competitive debut for Jose Mourinho's United on Friday evening as they open the 2018-19 Premier League campaign against Leicester City at Old Trafford. World Cup-winner Pogba is due to resume training later this week, while Sportsmail recently reported that Mourinho wants to give Pereira a chance to prove his worth this term following some eye-catching displays on that ill-fated US trip. The 22-year-old academy graduate was previously sent to La Liga for successive season-long loan spells at Granada and Valencia."
"Antonio Cassano insists he's ready to make his fourth retirement U-turn in the past year and return to action with a Serie A club this season. Cassano hit the headlines 13 months ago when he signed with newly-promoted Hellas Verona before opting to hang up his boots just a week later after appearing in two pre-season friendlies.  But at the press conference in which he planned to announce his retirement, Cassano decided in the space of four hours that he would continue playing, before sensationally performing yet another U-turn a week later as he quit football.  Now the 36-year-old has announced he is seeking a return to action, telling Il Mattino that he still has much to offer despite two years out of the game.  'Remember [Matias] Almeyda, the Argentina midfielder who played with Parma and Lazio? He stopped for two years then started again with River Plate, who play in a physical league,' Cassano said.  'If I have the opportunity, I'll always make a difference. I'm 110 per cent, I feel good with my head and my body – as for the feet, I can play until I'm 60!  Cassano, who played for Real Madrid, AC Milan and Roma during the peak of his career, listed a wide range of Serie A clubs where he believes he would fit in.   'I often talk with my agent, he performs miracles,' the ex-striker added. 'I would like to play for a team near Genoa, where I live – maybe Bologna, Sassuolo, Parma, Torino…but also Empoli and Cagliari – because I cannot live without my family. 'There are things that make a difference for me, like accompanying my children to school.'  The former Italy international then took aim at the rest of Serie A, claiming that the league is not of the same standard as when he burst onto the scene as a teenager with hometown club Bari.   'Can I make a difference? In this league? Yes. Today's Serie A is a race with quantity, little footballing intelligence and quality. When I started at the end of the 1990s, there were absolute champions,' he added. 'I remember Fiorentina: They only reached sixth place with Edmundo, Gabriel Batistuta and Rui Costa. Apart from Cristiano Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higuain and Miralem Pjanic, I don't see many champions around. Some of the players today wouldn't have gotten close to the training ground 20 years ago.' Cassano was last seen in action playing at the Match of Colour charity game in May, alongside his former Roma strike-partner Francesco Totti in Genoa.  "
"Liverpool defender Andy Robertson has heaped praise on Alisson for his distribution against Napoli on Saturday. The Brazilian has made a real impression since joining Liverpool in a £65million deal from Roma and shone in his first appearance as they comprehensively defeated Napoli in Dublin. Robertson, who played just over an hour of the friendly, believes Alisson's distribution from the back will be a real beneficiary this season and claimed he has already established a bond with the defenders in front of him. 'All goalkeepers are different so it takes a bit of time, but this result will help the defence and help him know how we play as well,' Robertson told Liverpoolfc.com. 'I thought he looked very comfortable and I think we adapted to him quite easily. 'He was very comfortable on the ball five minutes in and it meant we could show for it and he was starting most of our play, so it was a very good performance from him.'   Despite hooking up with the squad late due to his World Cup involvement with Brazil, Alisson's transition into a new team has been seamless and he is already a popular member in the dressing room.  Robertson added: 'From day one he settled in quite quickly. 'I think everyone knew from his first interview he spoke very good English so the settling-in period is over for him and I think he is very much part of the squad. 'Today he looked at home, he looked comfortable and when he was called upon he made the saves he had to make, so long may that continue and that will give him more confidence than he has already got and hopefully that will stand us in good stead for the season ahead.'"
"Mark Noble and Aaron Creswell teamed up to play a hilarious prank on new West Ham signing Jack Wilshere. The Englishman was led into believing he was sitting down for a run-of-the-mill interview with Hammers sponsors Betway to discuss his summer move to the London Stadium and how he thinks the club will do this season. However, the entire thing was an elaborate prank put on by his two team-mates.   The interviewer, Lee, was actually an actor  hired to play the role of a clueless interviewer. He was set up with an earpiece with Noble and Creswell, watching in a secret room next door, able to feed him questions to ask an unsuspecting Wilshere. The fake interviewer immediately made things awkward, telling the 26-year-old that he looked 'fit' as they took their seats. A sheepish Wilshere looked stumped as to what to reply before being asked whether or not he had had an initiation with his new club yet. Wilshere revealed he hadn't, admitting he had been worried about it. Little did he know he was currently in the middle of one. Noble then asked the interviewer to ask who would be first choice in the side out of himself and Wilshere. The former Arsenal man laughed before insisting the pair can play in the same team. Then Noble and Creswell decided to step things up a notch, asking Lee to pretend to receive a phone call from his fiancee before saying he couldn't talk because he was with 'John Wilshere'. 'He's fuming,' joked Creswell as the actor went on to ask if he was looking forward to going back to Arsenal and hoping to get back into the Ireland team.  The pair then decided it was time to put Wilshere out of his misery as the interviewer presented him with each of their West Ham shirts. The new Hammer saw the funny side as the group posed for a photo following the painful exchange."
"Dundee footballer Paul McGowan wore an electronic tag around his ankle as he played against St Mirren on the weekend after being spared jail in July for spitting on a bouncer. The Scottish Premiership player was warned he avoided jail by a 'narrow margin' after admitting to assaulting bouncer Andrew MacLaughlan by spitting on him outside Dundee's Underground nightclub in May.  The electronic tag, which McGowan must wear as part of his punishment, was clearly visible under his socks as he played 87 minutes before being substituted.  The midfielder had been drinking with other Dundee players before the incident took place earlier this year.  McGowan, a father of one, was ordered to wear a tag for two months, placed on a weekend curfew - meaning he has to be inside his Airdrie home from 7pm to 7am on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays - and under supervision for a year. Sheriff John Rafferty said after the verdict in July, the times were appropriately set to allow McGowan to play in midweek matches and weekend day time games, but he will unavailable for any evening fixtures due to the curfew. March 8 2010 – Assault, Breach of the Peace – Compensation of £200 April 5 2013 – Behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, Police assault – £1,600 fine. December 16 2013 –  Police assault (x2) – Community payback order with 130 hours unpaid work. March 19 2015 – Behaving in a threatening and abusive manner, Police assault – Restriction of liberty order for 16 weeks. July 16 2018 – Assault – Restriction of liberty order for two months, Community payback order with one years' supervision, 200 hours unpaid work and £200 compensation. The thug footballer, who has had five run-ins with the law in eight years - including attacking two police officers, was also ordered to do 200 hours of community service and pay his victim £200 in compensation. McGowan sparked a 'soft justice' row after escaping a jail sentence despite his list of previous convictions with many suggesting his profession makes him immune from stiff punishment.  The Dundee star, who Sportsmail understands earns around £600 a week, has still managed to retain his spot in the team and played competitively for them last month in the Scottish League Cup prior to featuring on the weekend.  McGowan, who also represented Celtic during a six-year stint earlier on in his career, will have to wear the tag around his ankle while he plays until the two-month order is served."
"Gary Bowyer has sensationally resigned as Blackpool manager just one game into the new season. The former Blackburn boss has worked miracles at Bloomfield Road on an impossible budget but his patience has snapped with owner Owen Oyston.  Oyston was informed of Bowyer's decision on Monday evening, leaving the basket case club in a sorry mess. Joined: June 1, 2016  Games managed: 115  Won: 42  Drawn: 40  Lost: 33  Win percentage: 36.5 Blackpool confirmed the news, which was broken by Sportsmail earlier on Monday afternoon, and revealed assistant Terry McPhillips will assume the manager's role until a successor is appointed. Sportsmail understands Bowyer had been paying for temporary training accommodation at Fulwood Amateurs out of his own pocket. Blackpool's training base at Squires Gate was described as a 'nicotine yellow' by sources earlier this summer. It is believed the 47-year-old has long held reservations about continuing as manager, coming close to taking over at Sunderland. He almost walked after winning promotion from League Two in 2017. Bowyer somehow managed to stabilise the Seasiders in League One last term with a backdrop of financial uncertainty and court battles. They drew 0-0 away at Wycombe on Saturday. Blackpool's immediate future looks bleak, with Oyston clinging on to power despite the High Court awarding former director Valeri Belokon £33million in damages for 'unfair prejudice' last November. Oyston still owes in the region of £25m and has been scrambling for loaned money in a bid to pay Belokon off. Belokon, a Latvian banker, has always maintained he wants to retain control of the club.  'It has been a pleasure to manage Blackpool Football Club over the past two years and there are many people I wish to express my thanks to.  'Firstly, all the staff at the club who continue to go above and beyond to support the team. The players, whose efforts and commitment have played a massive part in achieving promotion in the 2016-17 season and gaining a top half finish in League One last season. To my football staff, your support loyalty and incredible work ethic has been fantastic, your willingness to go that extra mile for the good of the club will never be forgotten. 'I'm extremely grateful to the board for giving me the opportunity to manage such an historic football club and finally, I would like to thank the supporters, your unbelievable passion and support of both the team and myself will stay with me forever. 'I wish Blackpool Football Club all the best for this coming season and every success in the future.'"
"Eleven Sports will be showing Cristiano Ronaldo's competitive Juventus debut live and free of charge on Facebook, the broadcaster announced on Monday. Following his £100m summer transfer from Real Madrid, Ronaldo should make his first league outing for the reigning Italian champions against Chievo at the Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi in Verona on Saturday August 18. Eleven Sports has pledged to show at least one match per week from both Serie A and La Liga on their UK Facebook page as part of an 'innovative partnership' with the social media platform.

"Tottenham are reportedly considering a late summer move for Celta Viga midfielder Stanislav Lobotka. Spurs have yet to make any new signings despite the transfer window closing on Thursday at 5pm for Premier League clubs. But manager Mauricio Pochettino is keen on  Lobotka, according to The Mirror, who claim that the 23-year-old has a £31million release clause in his contract at Celta. Napoli are also said to be interested in the Slovakia international, who joined Celta from Nordsjaelland last summer after starting his career at Trencin. He featured in all 38 of Celta's 2017-18 La Liga matches, helping them finish 13th. Lobotka was part of the Celta side who drew 2-2 at Fulham on Saturday after losing 3-2 to Southampton earlier in the week. Tottenham are short of holding options in midfield with Victor Wanyama nursing a knee injury and Mousa Dembele linked with a move away. Moussa Sissoko looks like a guaranteed starter in Tottenham's Premier League opener at Newcastle on Saturday, but who plays alongside the Frenchman is less clear. Eric Dier is a strong candidate, although he only returned to training at the weekend following an extended break due to his exertions at the World Cup. Academy products Luke Amos and Oliver Skipp both featured on Tottenham's tour of the US and could also be in contention."
"Leicester have had a bid for Mame Biram Diouf rejected by Stoke after the 2015/16 Premier League champions failed to meet a £15million valuation.  The Foxes previously had another bid for the Senagalese striker rejected after failing to meet the demands of Stoke, who began their Championship campaign on Sunday.  The 30-year-old - who joined Stoke four years ago on a free transfer from German club Hannover 96 - has been a target for Leicester during the past three windows, according to The Sun.   The forward featured in two games for Senegal at the recent World Cup finals in Russia and has made more than 120 appearances for Stoke, scoring on 23 occasions. However, Diouf was an unused substitute in Stoke’s 3-1 defeat to Leeds on Sunday in their first Championship game of the season.  Leicester boss Claude Puel has funds available after the sale of Riyad Mahrez to Manchester City went through last month for £60m.   The Frenchman has already signed James Maddison from Norwich for £20m, as well as bringing in Ricardo Pereira, Jonny Evans and Danny Ward. Only on Sunday, Monaco winger Rachid Ghezzal joined the King Power Stadium on a four-year deal, becoming the fifth signing of this summer transfer window. Leicester only have four days remaining until the transfer window closes, with a 5pm deadline on Thursday.  "
"Ilkay Gundogan believes Manchester City have hit the ground running ahead of the Premier League season, in a warning to those sides trying to topple the champions. Sergio Aguero netted twice to give City a comfortable 2-0 Community Shield win over Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday. This followed on from pre-season victories against Bayern Munich and Champions League finalists, Liverpool, during their tour of the United States.    Pep Guardiola's men enjoyed a record breaking title triumph last season, reaching 100 points to win by a margin of 19 points from their arch rivals Manchester United who finished second. Their title defence begins against Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday. Belgian star Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are due to return to the side following their World Cup exploits, as is David Silva. 'I was curious the way we would start the game and how it would go,' Gundogan told mancity.com. 'We knew what to expect and we knew it was going to be really tough. 'We did a great job. It was a very good start to the season for us. All in all it was a great performance and a well deserved win. 'I wouldn't say that it was necessary to give us confidence, but the first weeks when the season starts, the important games start, you never really know what to expect. You don't really know 100 per cent on which level you are. 'It was a great test for us, a last test before the Premier League season. At the end we feel ready right now and we can't wait for the season to start.' Aguero extended his club record with his 200th and 201st City goals, becoming the first Manchester City player to do so.  The 30-year-old joined City in 2011 from Atletico Madrid and has scored over 30 goals a season for the club in all competitions in all but three of his eight seasons.  Gundogan added: 'We feel very lucky to have Sergio in our team, a striker like him. 'On top of that even Gabriel (Jesus) with his ability and his quality. 'We have two great strikers and feel very, very happy.'  "
"Bayer Leverkusen forward Leon Bailey has revealed that there is 'concrete interest' from both Chelsea and Liverpool in securing his services this summer. The Jamaican youngster has been strongly linked with a move before the end of the transfer window with Chelsea said to be considering a £40m move. And he has admitted that the two Premier League sides and Roma have shown an interest. Asked specifically abut the three clubs, Bailey told Kicker: 'there's concrete interest. 'What I can say is that my full focus is on developing myself as a young player, and that's what I'll focus on. If a club wants me, my management and Bayer will take care of it.' For now the 20-year-old is focused on mounting a title challenge in the Bundesliga. 'We want to play for the title. Bayern Munich is one of the three strongest teams in the world for me, but in football you never know. We have to be focused, then we can do a lot with our quality to reach our goal.'  Bailey contributed 12 goals and six assists in 34 appearances in all competitions last season. "
"British racer Jamie Chadwick has become the first ever woman to win a race in the Formula 3 championship, one of F1's most prestigious feeder series. After starting in fourth place on the grid at Brands Hatch, Chadwick moved into third with an overtake on the first corner before fighting her way into second before the end of the first lap. Race leader Pavan Ravishankar was adjudged to have made a false start after the event and was handed a 10 second penalty, meaning Chadwick was promoted to top the podium. Chadwick, who was born in Bath, said after her maiden victory: 'I've wanted this win so much and have worked so hard to get it. It's an incredible feeling of joy and relief. 'I feel like we've been good enough to have four or five podiums but little things haven't quite gone our way. 'I was happy with my start and when I got into second place, knowing Pavan would receive a penalty, I was very comfortable.'  It was 20-year-old Chadwick's second podium of the year, adding to her third place at Oulton Park earlier in the season.  She said that her victory proved that racing success can be down to talent, rather than being male or female. She said: 'Today shows it's possible to win and nothing to do with my gender. When I'm on the money I know I can be the quickest.' Chadwick competes in the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship for Douglas Motorsport. F3 has traditionally been regarded as an important stepping stone for drivers aiming to reach F1. "
"There remains no let up for England's rugby stars as their pre-season training camp continued amid the gruelling summer heat. Head coach Eddie Jones has gathered his squad in Teddington, south west of London, for a training camp ahead of the start of the new domestic campaign. England don't play again until the autumn, when they face a crucial run of games against Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. But Jones has brought his squad together as they continue to build towards next year's world cup in Japan. Owen Farrell, Chris Robshaw and Mike Brown were among the experienced heads put through their paces on Monday. Alongside them at The Lensbury were the likes of Danny Cipriani and Chris Ashton — both of whom have recently returned to the international fold — and a number of young players.  In his 44-man squad, Jones named members of England's most recent Under-20s side — Joel Kpoku of Saracens, Leicester's Jordan Olowofela  and Harlequin Gabriel Ibitoye. Jones' side have so far endured a difficult 2018. They lost three straight matches to finish fifth in the Six Nations before losing their summer tour to South Africa. England were without their captain Dylan Hartley for the trip to the southern hemisphere after he was ruled out with concussion. The hooker has since returned to the fold and was named in the training squad. But he faces a race to be fit for the start of the season following the head injury he suffered during England's defeat by Ireland at Twickenham on March 17. England forwards coach Steve Borthwick said on Monday: 'I think that's ongoing as he progresses through the process. The start of the season is a month away so he's progressing. Everything's going well at this stage.' "
"British captain Dai Greene has been forced to withdraw from the European Championships in Berlin after yet another injury setback. The 2011 world champion was set to contest his first international championships for five years following a brutal run of injuries but pulled up with a tight hamstring in his warm-up before the first round of the 400m hurdles on Monday. The championships proper start on Tuesday. Team sources said he had been managing a problem in the build up, but there had been no indication that the 32-year-old would withdraw.  He had spoken of his joy around returning to the team on Sunday, saying: 'I'm excited. When you've had bad times it's the sensation of being the startline of champs which is the big draw. You can compete all season at the Grand Prix but they don't really mean anything. 'It's all or nothing when you get to the Championships. I'm looking forward to having that sensation again which brings out the best of me and my competitive side.'  Elsewhere, Dan Bramble qualified for Wednesday's long jump final with a 7.89m jump in Monday's preliminaries, while Daryl Neita scraped through the women's 100m qualifying round as a fastest loser in 11.48sec.  Nick Miller qualified for Tuesday's hammer final."
"The Vienna hospital where Niki Lauda underwent a lung transplant last week says the three-time Formula One champion is breathing without assistance and his condition is improving. The 69-year-old Austrian received a new lung last Thursday after what the Vienna General Hospital has called a 'serious lung illness.' The hospital says Lauda was fully conscious 24 hours after the operation and is making 'very satisfactory' progress and 'all organs are functioning well.' Lauda won the Formula One title in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He suffered serious burns in a crash at the German Grand Prix in 1976 and has twice undergone kidney transplants. Lauda was appointed as the Mercedes team's non-executive chairman in 2012 and was involved in signing Lewis Hamilton. He recently agreed to sell control of his Laudamotion airline to Ryanair.   "
"Britain's Katie Boulter was eliminated while Venus Williams and Julia Goerges progressed on a rain-hit first day at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. Boulter suffered a straight-sets defeat against Lesia Tsurenko in 85 minutes, the Ukrainian winning the first-round tie 6-4 6-2. The 22-year-old from Leicestershire had been targeting a victory that would probably have taken her in to the top 100 of the women's world rankings. British No 1 Johanna Konta, meanwhile, and her Chinese partner Shuai Zhang were involved in an epic doubles match at the last-32 stage. The pair recovered to beat Romanian duo Irina-Camelia Begu and Simona Halep 4-6 7-6 (7/1) 11-9 in a game lasting one hour and 45 minutes. In other action, No 10 seed Julia Goerges came back from the brink to win in her match with Timea Babos. The German lost the first set and the second went to a tie, but she fought on to win 3-6 7-6(7 /3) 6-4. Goerges will play Lucie Safarova in the second round after she beat Daria Gavrilova. No 13 seed Williams saw off Caroline Dolehide 7-5 6-1, although her fellow American - who is 110 places below her in the WTA ranking - served well with three aces. Serena Williams, who pulled out on the eve of the competition, revealed on Monday she had been dealing with the emotional strain of balancing motherhood with her search for further glory. Back on court, Anastasija Sevastova beat Aleksandra Krunic to set up a second-round clash with No 7 seed Garbine Muguruza and Anett Kontaveit defeated Ekaterina Makarova to meet No 8 seed Petra Kvitova. Magdalena Rybarikova beat Barbora Stycova to book a match with Caroline Garcia, the sixth seed."
"Dale Steyn is determined to make next year's World Cup his limited overs swansong and thinks his experience could make a big difference to South Africa's otherwise raw white-ball pace attack. The paceman is happy to admit that South Africa's main strike bowler Kagiso Rabada is now 'way better' than him, but the 35-year-old thinks the knowledge he has garnered from 116 ODIs and two previous World Cups could be invaluable in England. 'Our biggest problem in white-ball cricket now is our bowling,' Steyn said. 'I don't think it's a massive issue but I think in terms of experience it's our biggest problem. 'If you look at our top six batters, those guys have all played 800-plus games. But if you look at our bowling, our bottom four, they have probably played 150 games. 'That's a massive difference. There's a heavy weight that weighs up there.' Steyn believes he put his injury woes behind him in the recent two-Test series against Sri Lanka but was left out of the squad for the one-day series that followed and has not played a 50-overs international in nearly two years. The paceman said he had spoken to South Africa coach Ottis Gibson and will play white-ball cricket in England and in South Africa to get himself ready to be in a position to mentor the younger quicks. 'They are all learning as they play but unfortunately you can't go to a World Cup still learning. You need to know what you are doing,' Steyn said at a promotional event for GoPro. 'Even at 35 I am still learning but I know what I am doing. These guys need that. I am hoping that's what I can offer in the white ball scene and obviously play and win games for the country.' Steyn said he was particularly keen to help South Africa get the best out of 23-year-old Rabada. 'He's way better than me. I have obviously got my records and everything but he's way better than I am right now,' Steyn said. 'What he lacks is what I have, and that's what I can share going forward. I will just carry on doing what I do and he can feed off that, he can learn off that and he can just become so much better.'  South Africa will be without AB de Villiers at the World Cup after the batting talisman announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket in May. Steyn, who made his debut in the same test match as de Villiers in 2004, said the 34-year-old's retirement was 'super sad' for world cricket. 'The world wants to see their superstars and he's definitely one of them, if not the biggest one in terms of batting,' he said. 'Opposition fear him but you never really judge yourself until you have tested yourself against the best. If the best is no longer there it's quite difficult to judge yourself. 'He's only one player but he is a massive player.' Steyn wants to extend his career for a few years yet but thinks he will not be the only player to call time on white ball cricket after the World Cup. 'I think you are going to see a massive exodus. That's my opinion. I am being Nostradamus now and I am calling it,' said Steyn, who has taken 180 wickets in ODIs. 'What's the point really? Another World Cup will be in another four years and that's more than enough time for other bowlers to become amazing players.'"
"Kyle Edmund failed to clear the opening round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto after suffering a bruising 6-1, 6-2 loss to Diego Schwartzman. After rain delayed play, the British No 1 was dismissed in an hour by the Argentine No 11 seed on Monday evening. Edmund appeared outgunned by Schwartzman from the off, losing his first service game as the world No 12 notched up three. The Briton, ranked 16th by the ATP, made it on to the scoreboard in the fourth game, but he was broken again in the sixth and went on to lose the set. Edmund, who after a bye was knocked out of the Citi Open's second round by Andy Murray a week ago, appeared to have regained some composure as play resumed. However, with the score 2-2, the match ran away from him in the fifth game, Schwartzman breaking his serve. Edmund managed to save one break point in the seventh, but he was overcome by his opponent who took the match in the eighth."
"Dylan Hartley is facing a race to be fit for the start of the season as the England skipper continues his recovery from concussion. Hartley, who captained England to 21 victories in Eddie Jones’s first 22 games in charge, has been out of action since suffering a head injury during England’s Six Nations defeat by Ireland at Twickenham on March 17. The Northampton hooker sat out England’s summer tour of South Africa on medical advice, but returned to the England camp for last weekend’s training camp in Teddington. Asked if Hartley would return for the start of the new season, England forwards coach Steve Borthwick said: ‘I think that’s ongoing as he progresses through the process. The start of the season is a month away so he’s progressing. Everything’s going well at this stage.’ Head coach Jones, Borthwick and scrum coach Neal Hatley will travel to Japan on Tuesday for a 12-day coaching trip ahead of next year’s World Cup. Meanwhile, ex-All Black coach John Mitchell’s promotion to replace Paul Gustard as England defence coach gathered pace on Sunday with reports in South Africa stating that his current club, the Blue Bulls, are already ‘shopping around’ for a new head coach."

"There was French heartbreak for trainer George Scott on Sunday when the Newmarket handler was denied his first Group 1 prize by the dramatic record-breaking late charge of Polydream in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. The Scott-trained James Garfield, sporting the blinkers for the first time, had looked to steal a march on his rivals under a bold front-running ride from Frankie Dettori with the duo holding a useful advantage at the furlong marker. However, Maxime Guyon produced an impressive turn of foot aboard Polydream to wrestle the prize from Dettori's grasp in the dying strides and hand trainer Freddie Head a record seventh success in the high summer feature. The agonising defeat left a proud, but disappointed Scott, struggling for words. He said: 'He has run an incredible race, but my heart is broken. 'What a warrior James Garfield is and I am so proud of the race he has run. My staff at home have done a great job with him as he is quite high maintenance, but we can re-plan his campaign now after a performance like that. 'We have lots to look forward to and I wouldn't mind coming back to six furlongs now as he has enjoyed being ridden aggressively, although there is a seven furlong race on Arc day which could suit as well.'  Dettori was equally philosophical after the narrow reverse: 'It was an amazing run and he felt back to his best. It is a huge shame he didn't win, but the blinkers sharpened him up and he's run a huge race.'  British raiders were also third and fourth with The Tin Man and Librisa Breeze running terrific races to reach the places."
"From expensive summer signings to those returning after a standout World Cup, all eyes will be on the Premier League's big names when the new season kicks off. But which stars should you keep a particular eye on - and why?  Here, Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp picks the 10 players to watch, including Liverpool's midfield dynamo and a Fulham youngster looking to make his mark.  NABY KEITA, 26, LIVERPOOL  He's a little powerhouse — an all-action hero in midfield. Keita has a great touch, will make goals and score them. There is also devilment in his play and that could get him in trouble. We saw that last season when he was sent off four times. When Manchester United visit Anfield in December, I’m sure they’ll use every trick in the book to try to wind him up! But if he keeps his cool, he can be such an important player. The only time Liverpool missed Philippe Coutinho was against the more stubborn sides when they struggled to unlock the door. Keita and fellow arrival Fabinho can bring that guile to Jurgen Klopp’s midfield. MAX MEYER, 22, CRYSTAL PALACE Palace have committed a lot of money in terms of wages on the former Schalke star. I first saw him play against Chelsea in the Champions League five years ago. He is a neat and tidy player who is good on the ball but is yet to fulfil his true potential. At 22 there’s plenty of time for him to do so but whether he can at Selhurst Park remains to be seen. The big challenge for Roy Hodgson is how to use him. Will he sit in a midfield two or play as a No 10? I’m fascinated to see how this move turns out. AARON RAMSEY, 27, ARSENAL I'm expecting big things from Ramsey this season. Unai Emery must look at the midfielder and think, 'Why haven't Arsenal got the best from him?' What Emery has to do is give him more direction. There has been no pressure on any of the Arsenal players for the last few years under Arsene Wenger but now each will be given a defined role. Emery must tell Ramsey that his job is to make late runs into the box and score Frank Lampard-style goals. He has one year left on his contract and it is vital that Emery keeps him at the Emirates. Start the season in scintillating form and I can see Ramsey signing a new long-term deal. JORGINHO, 26, CHELSEA It is a good sign when a new manager’s first act upon arriving at a club is to bring in a player he has worked with closely. Maurizio Sarri rates £57million signing Jorginho highly and trusts him to be the pass master in Chelsea’s midfield. He has a lovely habit of finding a team-mate with practically every pass but he struggled against City at Wembley on Sunday and will need to get up to speed quickly. If he does, Chelsea should have a great balance in midfield with Jorginho alonside N’Golo Kante. They have bundles of energy and will keep the ball well. RICHARLISON, 21, EVERTON When I first saw him play for Watford, he was the closest I have seen to a young Cristiano Ronaldo. I’m not saying that he’s as good as the five-time Champions League winner. But I see in Richarlison the same attributes the 19-year-old Ronaldo possessed when I played against him. The Brazilian has blistering pace, is good in the air and loves to take on players. At times he over-elaborates with his tricks and flicks and his critics will point to the fact that he did not score after November. But there is a reason Marco Silva - who brought him to Watford this time last year - has paid £44million to take him from his old club. That may seem a lot of money now but if Richarlison fulfils his potential, it could prove a bargain. Everton’s new manager knows that if he can dig beneath the surface, he can strike gold. RUBEN NEVES, 21, WOLVES This player is central to everything Wolves do. He was their outstanding player in their promotion campaign and I’m confident he will make the step up to the Premier League. Neves likes to dictate games from midfield but he may find it tricky at first. He will not be afforded the same space he was given in the Championship. He was a showman last season - scoring six times from outside of the box - and I am sure we will see more of those magic moments. Nuno Espirito Santo has built a strong squad at Molineux and I don’t think they will be in any danger of going down. Impress this season and Neves could be set for a big move. PHIL FODEN, 18, MANCHESTER CITY I really believe this kid can be the future of English football. At the World Cup we were crying out for a creative spark in midfield and I hope one day Foden can be that player. He and Mason Mount, who has joined Frank Lampard’s Derby on loan from Chelsea, are two of the brightest young prospects in England. Pep Guardiola has seen enough of Foden to want to develop him at City rather than send him on loan. This is a manager who has worked with the likes of Xavi and Iniesta and that bodes well for Foden. This may not be his breakthrough year — it will be hard to displace the midfield geniuses of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva — but I’d like to see him getting more game time. The FA Cup and League Cup could be perfect stages on which to shine. JACK WILSHERE, 26, WEST HAM James Corden is trying to claim the credit for Jack going to West Ham after he came on A League Of Their Own a few weeks ago! This is a perfect move for him. He is the sort of player who will take the game by the scruff of the neck and conjure moments of magic. The West Ham fans should really take to him. Of course there will be question marks over his fitness and I have said for a long time that he needs to add more goals and assists to his game. But if he can stay injury free he has a great platform to get back into the England squad. For me this is the most interesting signing of the summer and I’m intrigued to see how he does. PAUL POGBA, 25, MANCHESTER UNITED Pogba went to the World Cup with plenty of questions hanging over him. Can he do it in big games? Can he score goals? Can he be disciplined and play in a midfield two? It’s safe to say he answered every one of his critics as France were crowned world champions. Didier Deschamps, the France manager, found a way to get the best from him so why can’t Jose Mourinho? I just feel there is another clash waiting to happen between these two and I find it difficult to see how they can repair their relationship. Mourinho has gone with the safe option of making Antonio Valencia his captain but I’d have given the armband to Pogba. By building the team around him, Jose would be challenging Pogba to prove he is an elite player by delivering captain’s performances every week.   RYAN SESSEGNON, 18, FULHAM  What strikes me most about Sessegnon is that nothing seems to faze him. He is only 18 but has already played 71 games in the Championship, scored 20 goals and been shortlisted for PFA Young Player of the Year. When I first watched him at left back I thought that he could be the next Ashley Cole. Now, his transition to left wing reminds me of Gareth Bale. Manager Slavisa Jokanovic has recognised that a player with such pace and skill can cause more damage high up the pitch. I don’t want to put too much pressure on him but I cannot see why he won’t take to the Premier League with the same confidence he has approached his promising career to date.  "

"The new Premier League season has finally arrived, and with it comes the hopes and expectations of many. Manchester City are hot favourites to continue their dominance under Pep Guardiola, while newcomers Wolves and Fulham have set down early markers with their aggressive approach to the transfer market. Sportsmail's resident expert PETER CROUCH gives his team-by-team guide for the campaign ahead.  How strange will it be in their first match against Manchester City when the camera switches to the dugout and Arsene Wenger is not there?  Wenger is all some people know of Arsenal and it is going to take everyone time to adjust. I do feel that change will be for the better, certainly in terms of the atmosphere at the Emirates. It had become toxic with so many wanting Wenger to go and it affected the players.  During Stoke’s game in April it felt like the home crowd were desperate to turn on him. It will be fascinating to see how Unai Emery gets on. He has been linked with jobs here before but with his pedigree he was always going to pick a top opportunity.  The squad he inherited is good and he’s made some interesting buys. I don’t expect to see them pushing for the title. They are still a good way short of the teams that set the standard. The realistic aim is trying to get back into the top four. HOW WILL THEY FARE? No title push but definite prospects of finishing in the top four. MAJOR INS Lucas Torreira (Sampdoria, £25m) Bernd Leno (B Leverkusen, £20m) Sokratis (Dortmund, £17m) Matteo Guendouzi (Lorient, £8m) Stephan Lichtsteiner (Juventus, free)  MAJOR OUTS Jack Wilshere (West Ham, free) Santi Cazorla (released) Per Mertesacker (retired)  The first thing you have to say when discussing Bournemouth is what a magnificent achievement it is for them to be looking at a fourth consecutive campaign in the top flight.  When you look at the size of the Vitality Stadium, it really isn’t geared up for the Premier League. Eddie Howe has done a tremendous job and has enhanced his reputation.  You have to admire the way they play football and, to give him full credit, he has remained loyal to his principles when the easiest thing would be to just try to get results. Each time they have looked in trouble, they have found a way to get out. But I have a feeling Bournemouth are going to find things difficult this season. There were a few bad teams in the Premier League last time and that helped them when they had a poor run.  Will they get away with it this time? I’m not sure. It’s not like they haven’t spent money, either, and you would be looking for some of those who have arrived for decent fees to produce. It is going be a long season for them. HOW WILL THEY FARE?  It will be touch and go whether they can stay up. MAJOR INS David Brooks (Sheffield Utd, £12m) Diego Rico (Leganes, £10.7m)  MAJOR OUTS Benik Afobe (Wolves, £10m) Lewis Grabban (Nottm Forest, £5m) Max Gradel (Toulouse, £1.8m) Adam Federici (Stoke, undisclosed) There were so many brilliant stories last season that Brighton’s achievement of staying up didn’t get the recognition it deserved. But here they are, looking forward to another crack at the Premier League.  My admiration for Chris Hughton, architect of their campaign, continues to grow. I go back a long way with Chris, who was my youth coach at Tottenham. He has gone on to prove himself a superb manager, first at Newcastle and then Norwich.  The players he has bought have fitted in well and I really like their centre backs, Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk. They don’t mess about, they get the job done and can play when it is required - just like the team as a whole.  It always gets said that the second season is the most difficult for teams who come out of the Championship but I’m pretty sure they will keep on surprising people. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Another season will see them get stronger. They won’t go down. MAJOR INS Alireza Jahanbakhsh (AZ, £20m) Yves Bissouma (Lille, £15m) Bernardo (RB Leipzig, £8m) Florin Andone (Deportivo, £4.5m) David Button (Fulham, £4m) Percy Tau (Sundowns, £2.9m) Leon Balogun (Mainz, free) MAJOR OUTS  Connor Goldson (Rangers, £3m) Jamie Murphy (Rangers, £1m) Tim Krul (released) Liam Rosenior (released) Steve Sidwell (released)  Towards the end of last season, I devoted one of my columns to why Sean Dyche should be viewed as the Manager of the Year. I wasn’t being disrespectful to Pep Guardiola or any of the other candidates but just an appreciation of the work Sean had done. Burnley being in Europe? Nobody would have predicted that. What a magnificent achievement. They remind me of how Stoke were at one point, with a team full of honest professionals all working for each other. They are going to find the demands put on them because of the Europa League taxing, when you have to go away to strange places on a Thursday and then play again on a Sunday. It was a problem for us in 2011-2012 and Tony Pulis took the decision to leave key players at home for league matches. But having worked so hard to get into Europe, Sean — who is clever and knows how to get results — will want them to do it properly. I don’t think they will match their seventh-placed finish but I’m confident they will be in the top 10 once again. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They are a good, solid side who will not be in the slightest trouble.  MAJOR INS None  MAJOR OUTS  Scott Arfield (Rangers, free) Chris Long (released) Dean Marney (released)  The one thing I will say with certainty where Cardiff are concerned is that every team who visits their stadium will be in for a horrible time. Neil Warnock isn’t going to try to win a prize for artistry. He is going to try to keep them in the division any way he can. It was a tactic that Stoke employed to great effect in the early years. We knew that certain teams hated coming to play us and were easily unsettled when the crowd got behind us and the game turned into a battle. It’s going to be interesting to see how the big teams cope in South Wales. If you had been given 10 goes to pick which team would come out of the Championship as runners-up, I don’t believe anyone would have picked Cardiff. They deserve huge credit for claiming back their place in the Premier League after a four-year break. Warnock’s teams are all about hard work, camaraderie and never giving up. They do have some quality in attack but let’s be realistic, if they finish one place above the relegation zone - whether it is by one point or one goal - they will have had an amazing season. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They are favourites to go down for a reason so 17th would be incredible. MAJOR INS Josh Murphy (Norwich, £10m) Bobby Reid (Bristol City, £9m) Greg Cunningham (Preston, £3.5m) Alex Smithies (QPR, £3.5m) MAJOR OUTS Matt Kennedy (released) Greg Halford (released) Ben Wilson (released)  It has been another summer of upheaval at Stamford Bridge and another change in the dugout. Maurizio Sarri has replaced Antonio Conte and I enjoyed watching his Napoli teams. They were always on the front foot and aggressive. Sarri also pulled off some great business on his first day. Jorginho is a good signing and just what they need. They missed Nemanja Matic after his move to Manchester United and the midfielder will fill that hole. But while I respect Sarri’s credentials, he is totally unproven in England and you can’t escape the fact his relatively late arrival was far from ideal. There is also uncertainty surrounding the futures of Thibaut Courtois, Willian and Eden Hazard that won’t go until the European transfer window closes.  This is going to be a transitional season. Chelsea replace their managers all the time, so I wouldn’t say that will be a barrier to success. It just feels like they are in a similar situation to Arsenal. Pushing for the top four will be as good as it gets. HOW WILL THEY FARE? In the mix for the Champions League spots but no title challenge.  MAJOR INS Jorginho (Napoli, £57m) Rob Green (Huddersfield, free) MAJOR OUTS Jeremie Boga (Sassuolo, £3.6m) Eduardo (released) Kenedy (Newcastle, loan) Lewis Baker (Leeds, loan)  The way things started for Palace 12 months ago, I did not think for a moment they would be a Premier League team in August 2018. No goals and no points from seven matches should have finished them but fair play - they beat the drop comfortably in the end. Palace are established and have a manager in Roy Hodgson who has seen it all but there is no getting away from the fact they are unpredictable. Every year they lose games you think they will win then win games you don’t give them a chance in. A lot hinges on how Wilfried Zaha is going to perform. He is still relatively young and will make the odd mistake but he’s a special talent when everything clicks. It’s crucial they hang on to him — he gives Palace so much that it’s no surprise the big boys are watching. It would have been nice if they could have had another season of Ruben Loftus-Cheek - I thought he was special when he played against us at the Bet365 Stadium in May - but they will pick up the points they need. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They’ll get plenty of points at Selhurst Park — it’s always a difficult place to play!  MAJOR INS Cheikhou Kouyate (West Ham, £9.5m) Max Meyer (Schalke, free) Vicente Guaita (Getafe, free) MAJOR OUTS  Damien Delaney (Cork City, free) Yohan Cabaye (Al-Nasr, free) Lee Chung-yong (released) Bakary Sako (released)  When I joined Sportsmail, Marco Silva was my first pick for the ‘who’s caught my eye’ section. He is a very impressive manager and I thought he did very well with Hull and Watford. He wants his teams to play with style and aggression. I rate him highly. Everton were in a similar situation to Arsenal in that they had to change the man in charge. I don’t think Sam Allardyce was popular and they couldn’t let that situation carry on. They just did not play well at any point last season. It may take time for Silva’s methods to work, though. I know Everton have spent fortunes in the last 18 months — close to £300million — but there is a rebuilding job to do and I don’t think it will be completed quickly. There is no point at this stage making big predictions for them. Silva needs time to put his stamp on the side and the basic target has to be a season of improvement and enjoyment for the supporters. When it all clicks, you can see them getting some big wins at Goodison Park. HOW WILL THEY FARE?  I don't think they can challenge the top six but should be comfortably in the top 10.  MAJOR INS  Richarlison (Watford, £44.5m) Lucas Digne (Barcelona, £18m)  MAJOR OUTS Wayne Rooney (DC United, free) Ramiro Funes Mori (Villarreal, £8m) Joel Robles (Real Betis, free)  Every summer there is a signing that makes you look and think, ‘How did that happen?’ I would say this year’s contender is Fulham’s capture of midfielder Jean Michael Seri from Nice. He’s been linked to lots of top clubs and I just didn’t think he would end up at Craven Cottage. It’s going to be interesting to see how they get on back in the Premier League. They are a good club and have one of the most exciting young English players in Ryan Sessegnon. He tore up the Championship last year and I don’t think he will be fazed about going up a level. Clearly, it’s gutting from a personal point of view that Fulham have taken our place in the Premier League. I always enjoyed my trips to Craven Cottage and it’s a stadium I have always enjoyed visiting. But so have plenty of others and that was a problem for them. If teams look forward to playing at your ground, it is usually a sign you are giving too many points away. This current team and their manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, strike me as having an edge to them. They have bought well and have got a good squad. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They will win more than they lose. I do not see them being relegated.  MAJOR INS Aleksandar Mitrovic (Newcastle, £20m) Alfie Mawson (Swansea, £20m) Jean Michael Seri (Nice, £18m) Fabri (Besiktas, £5.4m) Maxime Le Marchand (Nice, £3.6m) Andre Schurrle (Dortmund, loan) MAJOR OUTS David Button (Brighton, £4m) Ryan Fredericks (West Ham, free) When I was picking my manager of the year, I could have easily chosen David Wagner. Everybody at their club admitted it was going to take a miracle to stay up but Wagner was able to deliver the miracle. Obviously I can’t be too happy for them as they are where we want to be but as a footballer, I have total respect for the way those players got behind Wagner’s approach and squeezed the points from the games they needed. But can they do it again? I’m not sure. There will be a recognition within the squad that they are going to be near the bottom again and it’s going to be a big test of their new signings, all of whom seem to have arrived from Europe.  It could be a culture shock. To stand any chance of beating relegation for a second time, they have to hit the ground running but with Chelsea and Manchester City in their first two games, the tone could be set early. Another huge effort is required for another miracle. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Similar to Cardiff, finish 17th and that will be a huge success.  MAJOR INS Terence Kongolo (Monaco, £18m) Adama Diakhaby (Monaco, £8m) Ramadan Sobhi (Stoke, £5.9m) Florent Hadergjonaj (Ingolstadt, £5m) Juninho Bacuna (Groningen, £2.3m) Jonas Lossl (Mainz, £2.3m) Erik Durm (Dortmund, free) Ben Hamer (Leicester, free)  MAJOR OUTS Tom Ince (Stoke, £12m) Rob Green (Chelsea, free) There is no doubt that losing a player of Riyad Mahrez’s quality is a big blow but I like Leicester and think they will have a good season. This could be the year Demarai Gray steps forward and shows the potential that has been there for some time. What impresses me about Leicester is how solid they look. Kasper Schmeichel had a fantastic World Cup with Denmark and has seen it all, while the signing of Jonny Evans, to go alongside Harry Maguire in defence, was so sensible. When you add Jamie Vardy - who, fitness permitting, will score 20 goals - into the mix, you can see why I believe they will be in the top 10 and pushing for a place in Europe.  Everyone has watched Leicester with interest since they won the title in 2016. Things never went according to plan for the 12 months that followed but they look to be on a stable footing. Why can’t they win one of the cups? HOW WILL THEY FARE? They can get involved with the race for Europe  MAJOR INS James Maddison (Norwich, £24m) Ricardo Pereira (Porto, £22m) Danny Ward (Liverpool, £12.5m) Jonny Evans (West Brom, £3.6m) MAJOR OUTS Riyad Mahrez (Man City, £60m) Connor Wood (Bradford, undisc) Ben Hamer (Huddersfield, free) Robert Huth (released) My old club have had the most impressive summer in terms of transfer business and friendly results have been encouraging. The build-up to the season has been smooth. It’s going to be interesting watching Naby Keita in midfield. Stoke played RB Leipzig in a friendly this time last year. We won 2-1 but I came away thinking what a good player he was, so fast and dynamic. Liverpool needed something extra in midfield and he will give it to them. Keeping Mohamed Salah was critical and if he scores even half of the goals he managed last season, they are going to win lots of games. The addition of Alisson was expensive but they needed to address the goalkeeping position. If it clicks for Liverpool, they will be the team that comes closest to stopping Manchester City. They have been so exciting to watch and I can see it continuing. I know what it would mean to their fans if they went all the way. HOW WILL THEY FARE? All systems go for a title challenge. They are City's biggest threat.  MAJOR INS Alisson (Roma, £65m) Naby Keita (RB Leipzig, £55m) Fabinho (Monaco, £44m) Xherdan Shaqiri (Stoke, £13m) MAJOR OUTS Danny Ward (Leicester, £12.5m) Emre Can (Juventus, free) Ovie Ejaria (Rangers, loan) Jon Flanagan (Rangers, free) One of the easiest subjects I had to write on during my first year with Sportsmail was Pep Guardiola’s team. I kept saying they were on a par with Manchester United’s Treble winners and Arsenal’s Invincibles. We will always remember City as The Centurions. To score more than 100 goals and finish with 100 points showed how much of a class above they were. When we faced them at Stoke in March, it felt at times as if they were playing a game that was two levels above anything we could match. It was frightening. They may have ‘only’ added Riyad Mahrez during the window but the squad is so deep and has such quality that Guardiola wasn’t facing an emergency in terms of strengthening. Basically, I can’t see anything changing their dominance. The big thing for them this season will be the Champions League. They have the numbers to make changes but not dilute their quality. Granted some luck, I can see them going very close in Europe, too. HOW WILL THEY FARE? A class above the rest. I expect them to be champions again.  MAJOR INS Riyad Mahrez (Leicester, £60m)  MAJOR OUTS  Angus Gunn (Southampton, £13.5m) Pablo Maffeo (Stuttgart, £8.8m) Angelino (PSV, £5m) Yaya Toure (released) Looking in from the outside, you don’t need to be a genius to realise this summer has not gone as they would have wanted. A word of warning, though, to anyone who feels they are in trouble: never write off a Jose Mourinho team. When all the players are back, look at the depth of their squad. Tell me how a team with Paul Pogba in midfield and Romelu Lukaku up front won’t win loads of matches? Pogba is someone I’m very keen on watching over the next 12 months.  He should come back from the World Cup full of confidence and I want to see him stamp his authority on the biggest games, like he did in April’s Manchester derby. If United add a central defender, they have the quality to push City all the way. I can’t talk about United, though, without mentioning their signing of goalkeeper Lee Grant. It has gone under the radar but it makes so much sense and I’d expect before long that he will be David de Gea’s No 2. He is different class and he deserves to be at a club that will be expecting to challenge for honours. HOW WILL THEY FARE? No chance of losing their top four place and don't rule out a title push.  MAJOR INS  Fred (Shakhtar Donetsk, £52m) Diogo Dalot (Porto, £17.4m) Lee Grant (Stoke, £1.5m)  MAJOR OUTS Daley Blind (Ajax, £18m) Sam Johnstone (West Brom, £5m) Michael Carrick (retired)  You look from afar and see a club that has everything to take off. In Rafa Benitez they have a fantastic manager whose success at the top speaks for itself. Every time you go to St James’ Park, you feel how desperate the fans are for success but you also know they have been unhappy for some time with the ownership. Clearly the owners are operating to a different agenda to Rafa’s. If they were all pulling in the same direction what could they achieve? Until that day arrives they will continue to be in mid-table, heading towards the top 10. They look short of goals but I like the signing of Ki Sung-yueng, who’s always impressed me. He is a good midfielder with plenty of ability - and those sentiments can also be applied to Jonjo Shelvey. If he kicks on again, I don’t see why he won’t be considered for England. They have more than enough to get the results Newcastle need. HOW WILL THEY FARE? They won’t be anywhere near trouble at the bottom but they will be short of the European places. MAJOR INS  Yoshinori Muto (Mainz, £9.5m), Martin Dubravka (Sparta Prague, £3.6m) Fabian Schar (Deportivo, £3m) Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea, free) Kenedy (Chelsea, loan) MAJOR OUTS Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham, £20m) Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad, £10m) Chancel Mbemba (Porto, £7.2m) Jesus Gamez (released) Massadio Haidara (released) It was close last season at the bottom of the table and I don’t think for one minute fans will tolerate a repeat this year. They have spent a lot of money and Mark Hughes, a manager I know well, has assembled a good squad. Stuart Armstrong from Celtic looks a smart acquisition. I watched a few Celtic games last season and he always caught the eye. Brendan Rodgers spoke positively about him and I’ll be interested to see how he handles the switch from Scotland. I expect them to be comfortably safe but you can imagine the fans will want a little bit more than just safety, pushing for the top 10. They are an established Premier League club and spent back-to-back seasons in Europe. Saying that, Dusan Tadic, who has been sold to Ajax, is a big loss. He was always capable of doing something unexpected and making a difference. The one thing they need is a match winner. HOW WILL THEY FARE? The worries of relegation won’t arise this time and the minimum target should be top 10. MAJOR INS Jannik Vestergaard (Gladbach, £18m) Mohamed Elyounoussi (Basle, £16m) Angus Gunn (Man City, £13.5m) Stuart Armstrong (Celtic, £7m)  MAJOR OUTS  Dusan Tadic (Ajax, £10m) Florin Gardos (released) Jeremy Pied (released) Guido Carrillo (Leganes, loan) Jordy Clasie (Feyenoord, loan)  All the talk going into the season has been the fact they have not signed anyone. It has led some people to suggest their run of three consecutive years inside the Premier League’s top three will end. Unless I’m missing something, don’t Tottenham still have the players who were responsible for getting those results? The best business they could have made this summer was securing Harry Kane  to a new long-term deal and that was mission accomplished. Initially my concern for them would be the fact they had nine players involved in the World Cup semi-finals and there could be a slight hangover. If you don’t have a proper pre-season, you have to play catch up and it leads to early sluggishness. But I don’t have any worries about how they will perform over the campaign as a whole. Mauricio Pochettino is a fantastic manager and the squad continues to improve. If they can add Jack Grealish before the deadline, he has the potential to get into the England squad. HOW WILL THEY FARE? One of the best teams in Europe, never mind one of the best teams in England. Certainties for the top four.  MAJOR INS None  MAJOR OUTS  Keanan Bennetts (Gladbach, £2m) Anton Walkes (Portsmouth, £200k)  It’s hard to know what to make of them. Vicarage Road is a traditional ground and the fans get right behind them but the actual set-up is odd.  They have gone through so many managers but it seems to work. The fact they are continually changing, though, means they lack identity. They have a few players most football fans around the country would struggle to name and most of their signings leave you asking, ‘Who’s he?’.  This approach wouldn’t suit every club but they’ve established themselves in the Premier League. Being established, however, doesn’t mean anything. Stoke were in the top flight for 10 years and look where we are now.  Saying that, I can see them getting big results along the way, as they always do. In recent years they have beaten Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Chelsea at home and I would imagine they will get another success like that this season. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Should stay up but are going to lose more than they win. One day it’ll catch up with them.  MAJOR INS Gerard Deulofeu (Barcelona, £15m) Adam Masina (Bologna, £4.5m) Ben Foster (West Brom, £4m) Ken Sema (Ostersunds, £2m) Marc Navarro (Espanyol, £1.8m) Ben Wilmot (Stevenage, £1.5m) MAJOR OUTS Richarlison (Everton, £44.5m) Nordin Amrabat (Al Nassr, £4m) Costel Pantilimon (N Forest, undisc) If it had not been for Liverpool’s spectacular dealings, all eyes would have been on West Ham. After the disappointment and unhappiness of last year, the owners have gone for it in a big way.  Give them credit, they have not messed around. Midfielder Felipe Anderson, for a club record, and Jack Wilshere have been the headline-grabbing arrivals but I like the signing of Andriy Yarmolenko, too. I know Stoke tried to sign him once. He is an exciting player who will score and create goals, which should help relieve the pressure on Marko Arnautovic, who had too much responsibility on his shoulders last season.  Marko is someone I know well and I rate him highly. He is going to be the key man again and I can see people raving about him. Manuel Pellegrini sets his teams up to attack and it will be entertaining at the London Stadium - which is what the fans want. HOW WILL THEY FARE? Looking forward to watching them in action and they will get plenty of points at home.  MAJOR INS  Felipe Anderson (Lazio, £40m) Issa Diop (Toulouse, £22m) Andriy Yarmolenko (Dortmund, £17m) Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea, £7m) Fabian Balbuena (Corinthians, £3.6m) Jack Wilshere (Arsenal, free) Ryan Fredericks (Fulham, free)  MAJOR OUTS Reece Burke (Hull, £1.5m) James Collins (released) Patrice Evra (released)   The first thing you say about any team that wins promotion is they will do well to stay up. With Wolves, though, I think we change that statement. We played them a few weeks ago in a friendly.  I was up front and wanted to test their three central defenders to see what they were like, pulling on them to see if I could expose them. They all stood up to it. Given they won the Championship with such exciting football, I thought they would be vulnerable defensively but they are solid and have got quality in all areas.  Ruben Neves is a class act in midfield while Morgan Gibbs-White, who won the Under-17 World Cup with England, has a bright future. Be under no illusion, this is a good side. I was very impressed with them and they look well equipped for the battle ahead. They won’t be anywhere near trouble. HOW WILL THEY FARE? The potential dark horses of the season. I’m not sure they have got lots of goals in them but they won’t be getting relegated.  MAJOR INS Diogo Jota (Atletico, £12.6m) Benik Afobe (Bournemouth, £10m) Willy Boly (Porto, £10m) Joao Moutinho (Monaco, £5m) Leo Bonatini (Hilal, £3.6m) Rui Patricio (Sporting Lisbon, free) Raul Jimenez (Benfica, loan) MAJOR OUTS  Benik Afobe (Stoke, £12m) Barry Douglas (Leeds, £3m) Ben Marshall (Norwich, £1.5m) Roderick Miranda (Olympiacos, loan"
"Alongside the race for the title and a spot in the Champions League, the Premier League's most prolific forwards will have one eye on another prize. The Premier League Golden Boot is among the most sought-after individual gongs on offer for those with an eye for goal.  Liverpool's Mo Salah pipped Harry Kane to the title last season after scoring an incredible 32 league goals during his maiden season back in England — a new record for a 38-game campaign. The Egypt international beat off competition from Harry Kane (30) last year but this season's edition promises to be more than a two-horse race.  Several of the big clubs boast strikers with a realistic shot at capturing the crown. Among them is Sergio Aguero, who on Sunday sent out a warning to his rivals with a brace in the Community Shield for Manchester City. But who will come out on top come May? Here, Sportsmail runs through the main contenders. The holder and the fulcrum of Liverpool's devastating front line, Salah is man to beat this season. The Egypt international has quickly become a cult hero on Merseyside after leading Jurgen Klopp's side to a top-four finish and the Champions League final. Flanked by the dangerous Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, the winger terrorised defences across the continent, using his blistering pace, quick feet and cool head to more than justify his £39million price tag. Klopp has this summer spent heavily on the likes of Naby Keita, whose creative talents should only help Salah's pursuit of more goals. He has been prolific in pre-season and should be fresh after Egypt's group-stage exit from the World Cup. Manchester City's all-time leading goalscorer threw down the gauntlet to his rivals when he netted twice in the Community Shield to sink Chelsea. The Argentine, who won the Golden Boot in 2014-15, still racked up an impressive tally of 21 last season — despite making only 22 starts for Pep Guardiola's side. Aguero faces competition from Gabriel Jesus for a starting berth in City's side and Guardiola's embarrassment of riches may limit the forward's chances of matching the likes of Salah who, if fit, will likely start week-in, week-out. But like Salah, Aguero shouldn't be too burdened by his exploits in Russia, where Argentina were eliminated at the round of 16. The England captain would have won a third consecutive Premier League Golden Boot were if not for Salah's ludicrous return last season. Kane still netted 30 goals for Mauricio Pochettino's side and ended the season with another gong under his arm after top scoring on the biggest stage of all. The forward looked to be carrying a knock towards the end of England's run to the semi-finals, however, and only returns to training this week ahead of the new campaign. It could take him a few weeks to rediscover his best form... but Kane always gives his rivals a month's head-start anyway. Will this year be the one he finally nets a league goal in August? Manchester United's No 9 finished last season on 16 league goals - an impressive return but precisely half the number his rival from down the East Lancs Road managed for Liverpool. The Belgium star heads into the new season on the back of a brilliant World Cup campaign, however, with his dominant display against Brazil highlighting his rare qualities. Should he consistently rediscover that dangerous cocktail of speed, strength and skill for United, he will surely add to last season's tally. And Should Paul Pogba replicate his international form for United this season, Lukaku can likely count on improved service, too. Arsenal's record signing is the man tasked with spearheading the post-Arsene Wenger era under Unai Emery. The Gabon international is less accustomed to the particular demands of the Premier League but he has had the luxury of a full pre-season to further bed in and learn the ways of his new manager. Not that Aubameyang struggled following his January move from Borussia Dortmund. The £56m striker netted 10 goals in his 13 league appearances for the Gunners.  "
"Can anyone topple Manchester City? How will Arsenal fare in their brave new era? And will Jose Mourinho ever learn to love Paul Pogba? Fresh from the World Cup in Russia, Martin Keown and Chris Sutton debate the burning issues ahead of the new Premier League season.  Sportsmail's JAMES RESTALL asked the questions... KEOWN: Liverpool have City’s card marked. They were the first team to beat them in the Premier League and saw them off twice in Europe. What they lacked was the consistency to mount a title challenge but have spent a fortune to close their 25-point gap on City. I feel Jurgen Klopp is on a journey. I played against the Liverpool sides of the late Eighties and they would steamroller their opponents, particularly at Anfield. That is what Klopp’s teams do. I recently watched the excellent BBC documentary Shankly: Nature’s Fire. His teams played for the people and it is the same with Klopp. He is wired in to the emotion of the Merseyside fans. He has strengthened every compartment of his team. Andrew Robertson and Virgil van Dijk filled the gaps in defence. Now he has added quality in midfield with Naby Keita and Fabinho and spent a world-record fee for a goalkeeper. Toppling Pep Guardiola will take some doing but City’s goal will be to win the Champions League. So fierce is the competition that I cannot see one team winning both the league and European Cup. There is not the same pressure at Anfield. Maybe, just maybe, this could be their year. SUTTON: City won’t rack up 100 points but the title is staying at the Etihad. I just cannot look past their strength in depth. John Stones looked right at home at the World Cup and he ended the season as City’s fourth-choice centre back. Leroy Sane, one of their most lethal weapons, has had his feet up all summer. He’ll be desperate to show why Germany should have picked him. City’s football is breathtaking. Their players know what it feels like not just to be champions but to utterly dominate and Guardiola won’t take his foot off the pedal. Do Liverpool know how to beat City? Yes. Will their spending make it a tighter title race? Yes. Are they consistent enough to topple City? I’m not so sure. KEOWN: I wish someone could help Mourinho hold his tongue. He has invited this scrutiny by drawing attention to his team’s poor performances. It’s only pre-season! Arsenal beat PSG 5-1 but no one is saying they will be champions. Working for someone who is never satisfied is difficult. Mourinho’s personal quest for greatness seems to be suffocating his players. Pogba was excellent in the World Cup final but could have easily been dropped after a below-par display against Australia in the group stage. Didier Deschamps stuck by him, backed him and he grew through the tournament. From day one at Chelsea, Mourinho said Frank Lampard was a world beater - and he then started playing like one. United have a formidable group of players but Mourinho needs to learn how to love them. SUTTON: I said recently that if Jose Mourinho carries on with these outbursts, he is in danger of being out of a job before Christmas. Manchester United have gone from runners-up to complete turmoil. He’s been telling us that his side aren’t good enough, moaned about the lack of signings and risked upsetting Paul Pogba. How can anything positive come from this? United are the side most in danger of dropping out of the top four. If they get off to a bad start there will be more infighting, more moods, more outbursts and that is only going to end one way.  KEOWN: It may be all change but there will always be expectation. Unai Emery is a successful manager who is not here to finish fifth. I’m not saying they are ready for a title challenge but the top four has to be the objective. I’ve been impressed with Emery. He has worked his players hard in pre-season. Arsenal’s away form was embarrassing but they will have a better balance this year. They have a warrior in Sokratis while Lucas Torreira can bring bite to the midfield. Unlike their rivals, Arsenal only had one player in the World Cup semi-finals. City had seven. When they travel to the Emirates on Sunday the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Raheem Sterling may be unavailable. Arsenal will not have a better chance to beat the all-conquering champions. Do so, and they could steal a march on their rivals. SUTTON: The top four will be their goal but the Europa League may prove the more attractive route into the Champions League.  Emery won the competition three times with Sevilla, and Arsenal don’t look stronger than last season’s top four. Sixth is not good enough for this club. Even if they finish in that position again, the season will still be viewed as a success if performances improve. KEOWN: It will be a massive help. They don’t want to be at Wembley for any longer than they need to be. Opening the new ground against Liverpool will be great theatre. The stadium will have a galvanising effect on the club. SUTTON: Tottenham dropped just four points in their last season at White Hart Lane and this ground will become a similar fortress. The only thing I don’t get about the stadium is the microbrewery and artisan bakery. What’s wrong with a good old pie and pint? KEOWN: Managerial change is commonplace at Chelsea but after arriving with only a month to go until the start of the season, Maurizio Sarri has it all to do. Not only have his squad had little time to adapt to his 4-3-3 system, most of Chelsea’s World Cup stars have only just returned. Should it all click they will be mouthwatering to watch. Antonio Conte is a serial winner but his side had become too predictable. Sarri has huge experience but he’ll need to use all of it if Chelsea are to hit the ground running. SUTTON: Chelsea’s season hinges on Eden Hazard. He is so influential and Wilfried Zaha at Crystal Palace is the only player whose departure would be as damaging for one club. Hazard was unplayable at times last season. Should he leave, getting back into the top four will be an uphill struggle. Once again, Roman Abramovich will be expecting Chelsea to push but I cannot see Sarri having the same instant impact as Conte two years ago. KEOWN: If I was one of our World Cup stars, I would cut my holiday short. Stones had an excellent tournament but had only played twice for Manchester City since March. He faces stiff competition from Nicolas Otamendi, Aymeric Laporte and Vincent Kompany for a place. SUTTON: I saw Ruben Loftus-Cheek has already gone back to Chelsea. He knows it is on the training pitch where he can prove that he should be picked ahead of Jorginho, N’Golo Kante and Cesc Fabregas.  Managers will go for the players who they believe give them the best chance of winning. It’s up to the English players to show why they deserve to be selected. Which hot-shot will win the Golden Boot? KEOWN: Kane is the safe bet but don’t rule out Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He scored 10 in 13 after joining in January and posted similar figures to Kane in his last three years at Dortmund.  SUTTON: If Harry Kane stays fit it’s no contest. What makes him so difficult to face is that he is always one step ahead of the defenders. He now scores as many goals with his left foot as his right. I can’t see Mo Salah repeating last season’s extraordinary numbers. To remain as prolific then, like Kane, he must keep developing his game.  Finally... predict the top four  KEOWN: I’m going to put my neck on the line and say Liverpool to win it, followed by City, Spurs and United. But Arsenal and Chelsea can sneak in. SUTTON: City will win the title with Liverpool second. It’s too close to call between the next four but Tottenham will finish third and United fourth... just.  KEOWN 1. Liverpool 2. Manchester City 3. Tottenham 4. Manchester United   SUTTON 1. Manchester City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Manchester United "
"There will be a time, probably in the first game of the Premier League season, when fans will be waiting for VAR to correct a perceived injustice. They'll be making the TV signal in the stands and on the sofa at home! Except, VAR isn't there. I've been asked if the Premier League have missed a trick by not implementing video technology, especially as it was so well received at the World Cup. But they are right to wait another 12 months. A good referee does not make a good VAR referee, and the Premier League need to find both and give them more experience. One of the big concerns from last season was the time it took to review decisions. The Premier League did not want to spoil the flow of the game, because this league is the fastest in the world.  I get that, but if you look at the World Cup, it did not feel as if the reviews impacted on the game. There was a time towards the end of the group stage when VAR was coming in for a bit of criticism. But after the reversal of an offside decision to award South Korea a goal in their 2-0 win over Germany, attitudes changed, with the pundits in the TV studios and at home. It added to the drama of that game, and it was the correct call. I want to see the system become more transparent though. The decision should be shown on a big screen in the stadium and I want to hear what the referees are saying to each other. By the time VAR comes into use in the Premier League, I hope the transparency is there. For now, we have to wait — it will definitely be worth it. STOP SHIRT-PULLING  Where do you start with shirt-pulling in the penalty area? Well, you start by referees stamping it out without the need for VAR. The best referees will have studied the players they are refereeing and should be aware of tactics such as shirt-pulling and blocking from set-pieces. Give a warning before the corner or free-kick has been taken and then no player can complain if you award a foul. VAR was a deterrent at the World Cup, leading to more space and more goals from set-pieces. Good referees should do the same by making players aware they are on to them. In the early weeks we will see referees being extra vigilant. But let's not go from one extreme to the other. Remember, a lot of the time the attacker is holding the defender just as much as the reverse. I want to see referees being brave enough and clever enough to make the obvious calls, because that will lead to more goals and more entertainment - and that's what we all want to see. "
"The transfer window is close to shutting and the new Premier League season is just days away - so what better time for some predictions? Will Manchester City retain the title? Who will be relegated? And can anyone stop Real Madrid winning the Champions League again? Sportsmail's experts answer those three questions and have their say on plenty more as we look forward to another huge campaign.   IAN LADYMAN Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea Relegated: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Leicester FA Cup: Manchester City League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Stoke, Swansea and Middlesbrough Champions League: Juventus Pep Guardiola said his team can't match last season's phenomenal effort but why not? City have added Riyad Mahrez and their players will be better for last year. Europe may distract them but their rivals have too much ground to make up. Liverpool will improve on the back of summer business but not enough to make up last season's 25-point gap. I've put Jurgen Klopp down for the League Cup because has to win a trophy some time. Hasn't he? Manchester United will not be as bad as people have suggested simply because they never are while Spurs will be this season's big surprise and not in a good way. They have not invested properly and could suffer because of it. It's a shock to include Leicester to go down but they have lost their best player and will they keep Harry Maguire and Peter Schmeichel? In the Championship, Stoke have done some decent summer business and hired a sound manager in Gary Rowett while Swansea appointed the bright and talented Graham Potter. Middlesbrough have Tony Pulis at the helm and nobody would bet against the 60-year-old doing what he does best. IAN HERBERT  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea Relegation: Huddersfield Town Brighton Cardiff City FA Cup: Manchester United League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Aston Villa, Stoke, Middlesbrough Champions League: Juventus Manchester City will dominate again because it is a season of transition for Chelsea and Arsenal while Manchester United, consumed by Jose Mourinho's relentless negativity, are flat-lining and better off without him. Liverpool will be stronger but their defence is still a weakness. Tottenham may struggle to keep happy that English core who could earn bigger money elsewhere. At the other end of the table, Huddersfield and Brighton both looked vulnerable last season. Aston Villa's new wealth will catapult them back. SAMI MOKBEL Champions: Liverpool Top four: Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Newcastle. FA Cup: Tottenham. League Cup: Arsenal Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Derby Champions League: Juventus Liverpool's squad is significantly stronger following their summer signings.. If Alisson can live up to his billing, Klopp's men can overcome City. If Chelsea strengthen, they could push Spurs for the top four. I expect Mauricio Pochettino to finally lift the trophy noose around his team's neck while any trophy will be a satisfactory first season for Unai Emery. And even with Rafa Benitez, I fear the Magpies' lack of investment will catch up with them this season. In Europe, who'd bet against Cristiano Ronaldo? DOMINIC KING Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Relegation: Bournemouth, Huddersfield, Cardiff  FA Cup: Liverpool  League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Aston Villa Champions League: Juventus City set an incredible standard last year and history says Pep Guardiola's teams improve with each year under his supervision. It won't be as straightforward as last season but they are the team to beat. There is an idea that Tottenham are vulnerable and could miss the top four but Chelsea and Arsenal both have the Europa League to contend with and that likely schedule of Thursday-Sunday in the jam-packed first half of the season will be crucial. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be wrong about Huddersfield but it is going to be a big struggle for them. MATT BARLOW  Champions: Manchester City  Top four: Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Bournemouth FA Cup: Chelsea League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Middlesbrough, Stoke, Aston Villa Champions League: Juventus No team has defended the title since Manchester United in 2009 but Manchester City were so far ahead last season, 19 points clear. They are settled with scope to improve and Guardiola has form for stacking titles once his team is the way he likes it. Unless there is a calamity around the corner, it is hard to see them collapsing, while those in pursuit have differing degrees of disruption to work through. RIATH AL-SAMARRAI  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Everton Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Leeds Champions League: Juventus City haven't added much but what they have brought in - Mahrez - has strengthened an already exceptional squad. There's no place for Manchester United in my top four - Mourinho has already sucked the life out of them. Arsenal will need time to adjust to regime change and Liverpool will excel now that they have a top goalkeeper.  Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham badly need a trophy and ought to go all out for the FA Cup. In Europe, I fancy that £100m buys you rather a lot when it's Cristiano Ronaldo. CRAIG HOPE  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Southampton FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Middlesbrough, Leeds Champions League: Juventus Even if Spurs and Liverpool improve, the gap to Manchester City is too great to reverse in one season, but I expect those two to be the nearest challengers.  Manchester United may well take fourth and a League Cup, but I fear another miserable season of listening to Jose Mourinho sully what should be a brilliant and exciting football club to follow. LAURIE WHITWELL  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton  FA Cup: Tottenham  League Cup: Liverpool  Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Leeds  Champions League: Manchester City This has all the hallmarks of a Mourinho meltdown season, meaning United missing out on Champions League, while Sarri should bring the fun back to Chelsea. Picking teams for relegation is tricky - but it feels like gravity might just get the better of three clubs punching above their weight. This is the season Pochettino and Klopp are rewarded with silverware in the cups. It is tough to look past Real Madrid for the biggie, but Guardiola might just get it right again. SIMON JONES  Champions: Manchester City Top four: Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Relegation: Cardiff, Bournemouth, Fulham  FA Cup: Manchester United League Cup: Liverpool Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Middlesbrough Champions League: Manchester City City's race to the title will be closer run this season with Liverpool and Chelsea providing greater challenge. However, the addition of Riyad Mahrez plus the growing experience of their younger players will keep City ahead and capable of going all the way in Europe.  The summer investment from Stoke City and West Brom should see them make a swift return to the top flight. ADAM CRAFTON  Champions: Manchester City  Top four: Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal Relegation: Watford, Huddersfield, Cardiff FA Cup: Tottenham League Cup: Manchester United Promoted: Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Bristol City No side has defended the Premier League since Manchester United in 2009 and a decade on, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will prove themselves the greatest team since Sir Alex Ferguson's team of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.  At the bottom, Watford's high-turnover model will finally be caught out, Cardiff look too limited and Huddersfield will not be fuelled by the adrenalin of last season. JACK GAUGHAN Champions: Manchester City   Top four: Liverpool, United, Arsenal  Relegation: Cardiff, Huddersfield, Brighton  FA Cup: Tottenham  League Cup: Liverpool  Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Middlesbrough   Champions League: Juventus  It'd be a huge achievement if Pep Guardiola became the first manager in a decade to defend the title but they have all the tools to do it. City must be wary of Liverpool though. After coming so close twice in four seasons, the capture of Cristiano Ronaldo might be enough to see Juventus go one better this time. It’d be Ronaldo’s fifth in six years if they pulled it off.  Another summer of struggling in the transfer market could take its toll on Tottenham, with Arsenal having enough to potentially edge them and Chelsea. Manchester United will finish in the top four providing they start well."

Long gone is the era when teams only had two strips and even the home kit lasted two seasons.  Now you can expect around three new kits every summer and they add up stretched across 20 teams. So keep track with them all as they are released with our guide and verdict on all the designs coming to a Premier League ground near you soon...  Home kit It's a new era at Arsenal and while they hope for success under new manager Unai Emery, Arsene Wenger's replacement cannot be at fault for its messy looking start. Arsenal's first home strip under the Emery has, at best, received mixed reaction from Gunners supporters and it is easy to see why. You arguably have to go back nearly 25 years for the last time Arsenal featured as much white on the shoulders and sleeves combined. Done correctly it should not have been a problem but the thin red stripes on the sleeves do nothing to compliment the design. Should the good times come rolling back it may become a cult classic, otherwise this one won't be fondly remembered. HOME KIT VERDICT: 5/10  Away kit If Arsenal supporters are not happy with their home shirt then they may take comfort in a slightly better offering with their away strip. Granted, it is not the most striking kit produced for the Gunners in recent years but there will be far blander shirts released this summer, and it does look a touch better than the similar looking 'Dennis the Menace' strip from 2007-08. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Pop quiz. What links Arsenal's away strip and their third kit? The answer is Herbert Chapman and his WM formation from the 1930s. Confused? Take a closer look at the strips. While the away version has an 'M' stitched into it, the third kit has the attacking concept of the formation with the 'W'. Whether that gimmick is enough to win over Arsenal fans to the club's first green kit since 1983 is another matter. We've certainly seen worse though. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home kit and Away kit It's Brighton, it's blue and white stripes but there is still a big departure from last season's strip. The blue shoulders have made way for white, while the actual stripes are thicker. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff but it is at least a different offering from Nike. There's a retro twist to Brighton's away kit which is all green as a tribute to the strip won by the club when it was under the guise of Brighton United between 1898-99. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit Ah, the old switcheroo trick from Umbro, in football's laziest attempt to add some form of change to a team that play in stripes. This time it is red that features as the central stripe colour on Bournemouth's home kit, but at least there are a few added tweaks elsewhere. All black sleeves and limited gold trim are a nice addition to what is otherwise a standard Cherris home shirt. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Away kit No thrills from Bournemouth regarding their away strip for next term as they opt for a fairly simple white kit with navy shorts. Small details include stripes stitched into the kit and salmon pink trim on the sleeves - which seem more like an Umbro advertisement than anything else. It does the job of providing alternate colours to the club's traditional colours but that won't stop it becoming a forgettable kit by the time next May comes round. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Third kit Forget the away kit, Bournemouth - you won't be needing that anytime soon. That is because in the third strip the Cherries have all they need. The beach glass colour (no seriously, that is what it is called) looks striking with its tonal pattern on the front of the chest, making the away design looking even more bland than it already is. One negative is perhaps the third strip needed a darker colour to really draw it away from the away kit, but we can let good designs bypass this issue. Thumbs up to the team at Umbro. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Home kit The chances are Burnley will not be able to match their heroics last season when they stunned just about everyone to finish seventh - or as it is now called - best of the rest. So how do Puma celebrate what looks like being the major high point of their recent history? By releasing a new home kit that is close to identical as last season's strip. That's not even the worst part. Gambling sponsorships tend to make a shirt ugly anyway but when more than one language is squeezed onto a kit, it makes you start thinking of how long it will be before football shirts take a similar look to racing driver overalls. HOME KIT VERDICT: 5/10  Away kit Compared with the rest of the Premier League away kits this really is not that special, yet this may still be Burnley's best strip available this season. The black kit features a honeycomb print which becomes more prominent lower down the shirt and adds some form of design to what otherwise would have been a boring old black kit. Puma have ignored trying to weave it into the shorts but for the average fan buying it that is not going to be a problem. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Third kit Due to their Europa League qualifier with Aberdeen, Burnley were forced to rush out the unveiling of their third kit. And by the look of things, Puma were forced to rush out a design for it too. It's white with a hint of...well, white and complimented by... even more white. Throw in that horror show of a sponsor logo and you have one of the most boring and worst strips released this summer. Not even a tonal 'V' on the front is saving this. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 4/10 Home kit An all-blue kit may seem typically Cardiff City, but this is a whole different look to the one adopted by the Welsh outfit from the last time they were in the Premier League four years ago. This time there is no red kit nonsense or the hysteria around it, but compared to last season there is hardly any difference at all. Not necessarily a bad thing and there is a slight difference in terms of the this year's kit featuring a subtle two-tone showing of blue hoops. Otherwise this is pretty much the same Cardiff kit since they ditched Project Red. HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Away kit No massive design changes on the away strip either for Cardiff City, with adidas offering a similar template to that of the home strip. It being a grey kit with a standard template should make this kit rubbish, but that is not the case. The blue trim compliments the strip well, and the minor additions of thin grey stripes helps lift the kit out of blandness. Not bad. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit  It's not very often you see a splash of design on a Chelsea strip, but maybe Nike have found just the right balance for the 2018-19 season. The Blues' new home kit maintains the key details - blue shirts and shorts with white socks - but it's the invasion of the trim colours on the front of the strip that raises the eyebrows. The subtle but certainly noticeable white and red stripes that flash across the front and reverse of the kit certainly mark a departure from safe and simple in the design stakes. Red may have last featured on a strip as recent as 2016 but it doesn't happen too often these days. Fans are divided but at the very least it blends in well with the sponsor logo... HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit Chelsea's away strips over the last two or three years have been rather bland with its selection of black and whites. So the return of yellow to the strip is very much welcome, even if it is to just add some colour to the west London side when they are on the road. It looks very similar to the kit worn during the title winning 2014-15 campaign, and seeing as its their best away design since then, you wonder why they bothered to change it at all. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home kit Crystal Palace are more liberal than most teams that feature two predominant colours when it comes to mixing up their home kit, and 2018-19 will prove another change of direction. Stripes remain, and of course they are red and blue, but the cut of them is thicker. In addition the red stripe will gradually fade to blue going down the shirt. Yellow trim helps compliment the finish, with Puma's first kit for the club proving innovative and it has been well received by fans. It's just a shame about the ugly sponsor. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Away kit Not only have Puma pleased Palace supporters with their home kit but they have done the double with a classy away design too. For a certain generation it may as well be the home kit, as Palace played at Selhurst Park in white strip with a red and blue sash from the mid 1970s for nearly a decade. There was no need to make stylistic changes like with the home shirt and as a result the Eagles have two excellent strips for the new campaign. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home Kit Not much went right for Everton over the 2017-18 campaign but there is hope for the Toffees that brighter days lie ahead in the new season. For a start, supporters are sure to be delighted with their new home strip. But then considering it was made as a result of a fan consultation it is hardly a surprise. Umbro collaborated with fans to understand their preferences on colour, collar and other design features. As good as the finished article looks, it is odd to see the diamond Umbro template make a return to the sleeves. It was last seen on a strip that was worn when Everton were incredibly fortunate not to be relegated in 1998. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away Kit Everton have dabbled with pink a couple of times in the last decade but on this occasion it does not do enough to salvage an otherwise bland away strip. Grey is hardly the most inspiring of primary options for a colour on an away kit and it is not lifted much by the black sleeves that accompany it. The pink trim is a welcome feature and prevents THE KIT being flat out boring, but unless the Toffees end up wearing it in a 6-0 thrashing of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge it is unlikely to be well remembered, and more likely soon forgotten. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home Kit Fulham are back in the Premier League and to celebrate a return to the top flight, adidas have produced a home kit for everyone to celebrate like it is 1999. The late 1990s saw the start of the Cottagers' rapid rise up the ranks that would eventually lead to them getting promoted to the Premier League in 2001. The strip from the 90s had a hooped feature across the front and they are now back for the first time since those heady days under Kevin Keegan and then later Jean Tigana. It's a Pizza Hut logo short of completing that whole memorable journey of that period but either way it is sure to go down well with supporters. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Away Kit The home kit is where the originality ends for Fulham though, as they have been given an away strip that shares identical templates to many other clubs. It actually looks good with the white trim complimenting the various navy blue colours on the display. Then someone stuck a big yellow betting logo on the front of it. Stick with the home shirt. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home Kit Same old for Huddersfield right? Blue and white stripes job done. Well not exactly. Umbro have hardly pushed the boat out in terms of design, but they have not had to. For the first time in almost 50 years the Terrier will appear on the club badge and that is worthy enough of a reason to give an old Huddersfield favourite a traditional design and colours. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Away kit Much like the home kit, no chances have been taken by Umbro with what is being called an 'alternative strip' as the tried and trusted red and black show off the change colours. Last season's retro design has been shelved before it makes a possible reintroduction for the 2038-39 season following its next orbit in the retro kit stakes. So for now its just the home kit template with familiar away colours. Good enough for Terriers supporters but nothing to excite a casual. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home Kit A new team is behind the latest Leicester City strips for the 2018-19 season, with adidas supplying the Foxes for the first time in their history. You would not have guessed that too easily though looking at the new home kit, which in truth has hardly changed at all since that Premier League title winning campaign in 2015-16. The only notable alteration to the shirt sees white adidas stripes replace the Puma gold on the shoulders alongside a v-neck collar. Otherwise, the socks have a touch more white in what is another all-blue kit. Nothing to turn the heads of outsiders but it should be a hit with Foxes fans.  HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away Kit This looks like being the standard adidas away kit template for the season, as the design is exactly the same as Cardiff City's who unveiled their away strip earlier in the summer. The only differences then are the slightly darker grey colours, the orange trim and of course the monochrome Leicester badge which would not have been a good look on a Cardiff shirt. Otherwise this review should probably have just read 'see Cardiff'. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Already having a standard templated away kit, adidas have sadly not offered much improvement on making a third kit for Leicester. Admittedly there is not much to really criticise. The Foxes have always had white as a traditional away colour and the blue shoulders at least steer the design away from just being an all-white bore. But third kits offer a chance for a bit of flair and adidas have failed to accept the challenge. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Home Kit There are not too many ways you can change an-all red kit but in a world where the commercial arm of football clubs demand at least two new strips to sell every year, Liverpool seem to year-on-year get the balance right. No shocks once more with the home strip. It's red, albeit judging by the promotional pictures a slightly darker shade than usual. Trim remains white along with the club badge that featured in yellow for the 2017-18 campaign. A stylish buttoned collar is a welcome addition and back for the first time in five years. No thrills stuff but no complaints either. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit What is it with New Balance, and formerly Warrior? Why do they have to keep releasing these garish away strips for Liverpool that even the 1990s would turn their nose up at in disgust. This is not the worst of them from over the years but it would look much more at home as a training top or even a goalkeeper's shirt. The only explanation is that former Mexico keeper Jorge Campos has sneaked his way into the design team at New Balance. Either way, thumbs down. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 4/10 Third kit Now that is more like it from New Balance who have somehow managed to add some style to the the concept of a white and grey strip. It was a pretty simple solution but it was to model Liverpool's third strip off the kits from the 1980s, although not going as far as actually copying. The third kit is subtle, and stylish and more than makes up for the purple monstrosity. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home kit Believe it or not there is almost always a change to the predominant colours in a Manchester City kit and this summer's is no different. It comes in the socks which will switch from light blue to navy - in homage to the double promotion winning seasons and to return to the Premier League in 2000 and the club's first top flight title in 1937. City fans will not want to be reminded that on both occasions, relegation followed a year later. Not that we are suggesting Pep Guardiola's side are going down next season. There is more chance of City fans embracing the Champions League anthem and singing along with high acclaim for UEFA. This is a well designed strip though from the slightly darker trim on the arms to the added button on the neck. City are not only the team to beat on the pitch but in the fashion stakes too. HOME KIT VERDICT: 9/10 Away kit Nike are often accused of 'phoning it in' when it comes to designing kits but their latest away strip for Manchester City is proof that they can deliver the goods when they are not too busy playing on the ping-pong table near their work desks. Apparently this strip is a nod to the kit that earned them promotion from the third tier back in 1999. Colours aside, it looks nothing like it but that does not matter because with pin stripes and a pair of ultra bright socks begging to be caked in mud, this is a belter. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 9/10  Home kit Brave move form adidas. They could have quite easily have just designed a plain red shirt, stuck their stripes on to provide a return of black trim to Manchester United, then sit back and count the incoming coins.  But by putting a train track graphic on the shirt in reference to Newton Heath origins (whatever happened to the green and gold protests?) to mark 140 years (not a milestone) adidas may have a gone a step too far here.  The gradual fade to black down the front of the shirt merges well with the black shor...wait, black shorts! United playing with a red shirt and black shorts combination has been done many times before but only as a change alternative. So since changing the name to Manchester United in 1902, this will be the club's first ever season without white shorts. It's a brave new world at United, top marks to adidas for trying but have they gone too radical with this? HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Third kit Manchester United are a club steeped in history and tradition and they've honoured that with the unveiling of one of their new strips for next season. The Red Devils will go back to blue for the 2018-19 campaign when they wear their third kit with a design inspired by the 50th anniversary of the club's historic first European Cup win. The Red Devils wore blue in their defeat of Benfica to become the first English side to win European football's biggest club prize. The gold trim is a stylish touch and as a bonus blends with the sponsor logo. United often produce strong change strips and this is another of those. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 9/10  Home kit We get it, Newcastle play in black and white stripes and that is sacred. So on that note it is a little harsh to criticise Puma for a lack of ideas for a new home kit. But when the only solution offered is to change the shoulder colour to white and the order of the stripes on the front of the kit it feels rather lazy. The biggest departure on the whole strip is the change to white socks, otherwise what is the point? HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away kit It's been nearly a quarter of century since we were dazzled by Kevin Keegan's 'Entertainers'. And while Newcastle fans these days have the manager in Rafa Benitez they want to bring back the good ol' days of the mid-1990s, they don't look like returning to the business end of the Premier League anytime soon without serious financial backing. But there is a crumb of comfort for Toon supporters, with the away kit for the 2018-19 season a near copy of the hooped design worn during the 1995-96 Premier League campaign when they narrowly missed out on the title. It might not have the likes of David Ginola and Les Ferdinand playing in it, but it is one of the best strips you will see in this campaign. Only a silly betting company logo prevents perfection here. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 9/10 Third kit So how do you top that away kit? Well quite simply you don't and Puma know it. The only way in providing a third strip that will gather any sort of attention is to splash it in an outrageous shade of blue and hope for the best. And you know what? Those folks at Puma have pulled it off. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 8/10 Home kit Under Armour are in their third season supplying Southampton kits now and credit where it is due, have resisted the urge to just simply go through the usual motions of switching the colour of the red and white stripes. In fact last season they ditched the stripes all together. But it is back to familiarity for Saints fans as the stripes return complete with an all-red shoulder and sleeves combo. It is not groundbreaking but it is acceptable looking and wildly different from the previous season. Therefore a thumbs up from us. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Away kit Officially, this kit takes 'inspiration' from the strip worn in the 1976 FA Cup final victory over Manchester United. That is a bit cheeky from Southampton as it is no closer to the kit than their many other yellow and blue strips released from over the years. Still, this is their first yellow and blue change strip in the Premier League since 2005 and if we have learnt anything from the Swedish national team and to a slightly lesser extent Italian side Parma, it is very hard to get a yellow and blue kit wrong. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 7/10 Third kit And so Southampton become the first team to release their new home kit for the 2019-20 season, with a...wait this is a change strip? Now admittedly, and rather frustratingly this is a good design from Under Armour and one might have thought with a few tweaks they could have banked it and released it as next season's home strip instead. But nope it has been relegated to third strip status and as a 'change kit' offers very little change at all to the home shirt aside from the absence of white stripes. What a waste. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Home kit Tottenham Hotspur were the last team to unveil a new kit ahead of the 2018-19 season but this is not one of those cases of saving the best to last. Admittedly, the way the shirt blends into the shorts is a nice touch but as a stand alone shirt it looks rather tacky. The average Spurs fan has a dilemma. Risk the tacky look or match it with the shorts and walk into dangerous territory of being a full-kit-wa...wally. The team does not fully escape the problem. In Europe Spurs play with white shorts, so unless the club release a dedicated European kit (don't rule it out, someone has to pay for the stadium) the club are going to have a rather messy strip in the Champions League next term. HOME KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Away kit Now Spurs have the opposite problem to that of the home kit. As a stand alone shirt this is not a bad looking away design. The lighter blue shoulders are a neat addition to the navy strip but that is where the compliments end. The shoulder colours carry over to the shorts and socks appear even lighter. Many responses on the unveiling compared the kit to looking like pyjamas. So if Tottenham are caught napping on their travels next term, you have a go to excuse already made Spurs fans. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10  Home kit Watford have often been an accumulator breaker for many punters since gaining promotion to the Premier League  with their wild inconsistency. How many sides go unbeaten at the start of the season before losing 6-0 at home against Manchester City?  So adidas have celebrated this wild contrast by giving the Hornets a black and yellow striped kit for the new season. Unprecedented? Not quite. There was the more garish thin hoops on their Premier League return in 2015 but a more suitable link would be the decade between 1914 and 1923 when they wore black and white stripes. If a team that played in stripes all the time produced it, this would be boring. But this is a radical step on a Watford strip and it looks the part. HOME KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Away kit It's the same adidas template which will feature on many Premier League away kits this term, yet Watford may have the best of the bunch. Managing to avoid the drab grey as a primary colour, the all-green strip features various shades. It's something different from adidas, even if its skeleton is just the same as everything else out there. The big bonus for Watford fans was every supporter who attended an away game last season picked one up for free. A nice offer and probably the least they deserved having travelled to watch their team score only once on the road in 2018. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 8/10  Home and away kits The template for a West Ham kit was easy to follow for Umbro. Mainly claret but with plenty of blue too. Where in that memo it got altered to just plain claret shirt with a touch of blue trim is anyone's guess. Admittedly it is aesthetically not too bad - a little bland - and what perhaps saves Umbro is that West Ham have played in kits in the past with only a touch of blue - albeit rarely. The navy blue away strip although a similar design comes across a lot more acceptable... until you see the yellow socks. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10 AWAY KIT VERDICT: 6/10 Third kit If the World Cup taught us anything it is that white change kits have become a bit of a football trope in recent times. Granted, this strip is more of a hint of grey, with faint claret and blue patches on the shoulders at least offering some form of uniqueness. It's not exactly eye-catching, but we can at least forgive the claptrap about the kit being inspired from the early 1990s due to the fact that at it looks a lot different to the other two kits this season... doesn't it Southampton. THIRD KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Home kit Wolves are back in the Premier League after storming to the Championship title last term but it's all change in the aesthetics front for the Molineux outfit. No don't worry Wolves fans, it is not a sudden change of direction where the team plays in blue and white stripes and adopts a Throstle as part of the badge. Instead it sees adidas move in, and their first major change is to see the club restore a more traditional  golden colour to their strip. It is a simple change to a simple kit - but it will be a winner among fans. HOME KIT VERDICT: 7/10  Away kit When you play in gold and black, the need for an away kit is not all that great. But a team needs one anyway, and besides why miss out and let every other club try and rinse supporters dry for up to three replica kits? Onto away strip matters though, it really is a sort of nothingness like many other white away kits even if it is just the West Midlands club's second in the last decade. AWAY KIT VERDICT: 5/10 "
"There's been sadness behind the joy for Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the past 10 months. The collection of two gold medals tell a story of potential finally being fulfilled, but there has also been a painful loss. Her father, Ricky Thompson, passed away on his home island of the Bahamas last November, aged just 59, and despite living apart from his daughter in Liverpool since she was one, they had a good relationship. 'It's been difficult, especially winter,' Johnson-Thompson told Sportsmail. Aside from a short Instagram post the day after his funeral in which Johnson-Thompson detailed his 'infectious laugh and a heart of pure love', it's not a subject she's discussed publicly since, and yet it is also one of the driving forces behind her attempt to pull off one of the toughest challenges in athletics next week: beating Nafissatou Thiam across the seven disciplines of a heptathlon. If the 25-year-old succeeds against long odds by winning the European Championships in Berlin, it would complete an extraordinary hat-trick in 2018 for a talented athlete who had often underperformed on the bigger occasions before breaking through this season with gold medals at the world indoors and Commonwealth Games. That is a monumentally big 'if', of course. Those wins, grand as they are, were secured against weaker fields, while Belgium's Thiam is the reigning world and Olympic champion and the third best heptathlete of all time, with a top score of 7,013 points - achieved on the same weekend in Austria in May 2017 when Johnson-Thompson set her own personal best some 322 points astern. It's a big gap that feels bigger still when you consider Johnson-Thompson's revelation that her preparations for Germany have been significantly affected by the calf injury she picked up while winning at the Commonwealth Games. But bridging that gulf is where her father comes in again, for while it would be misleading to suggest her two gold medals were inspired solely by his memory - she would have beaten the opposition anyway - Johnson-Thompson is clear about the extra motivation she has drawn for Berlin from Ricky's death. 'What happened with my dad is why I have been so switched on in competitions,' she said. 'He didn't see me win and that has actually made me want to win in front of my mum (Tracey) even more, if that makes sense. 'She comes to see me in every single competition and I always feel for her when I don't do well, or I let myself down, or I don't reach my potential. 'I really want to involve her and I really want her to experience me winning and doing it. That is why I was so happy in Birmingham for the world indoors and the Commonwealth Games.  'When you miss chances, you feel like you miss giving opportunities for your family to see you do well. Your family are proud of you anyway, obviously, but this is just something inside me that pushes me on a bit extra.'  Missing chances has been something of a theme in Johnson-Thompson's career before this year. Great expectations have hovered over her since she became world junior champion in 2009 but it has been slow going - she blew it with three long jump fouls when sitting second at the 2015 worlds, faded to sixth at the Rio Olympics and wrecked her 2017 worlds in London with a poor high jump.  The throws have typically been her weakness, but the head had been equally suspect in big moments, and that is why there is such excitement within the sport over what she might now achieve with the confidence of two gold medals to her name. For that end, Johnson-Thompson sees the next three to four years as crucial, with a growing sense that time is hurrying along in her career. 'You do feel the years go by,' she said. 'Major opportunities come once year and you put it all on the line and if it doesn't go well then you wait an entire year for the next chance at a major medal. Like I say, you do feel the years going by when it's like that. 'I feel I am coming towards my peak opportunities in the next three or four years. I used to think Tokyo 2020 would be my main one but maybe it will be 2024. Maybe then I will go for a single event but I am going year by year.  'The next few years are important but I do believe I haven't my potential yet.' The strength of Thiam, who is two years younger at 23, has complicated the landscape, of course. 'She has achieved everything I want to achieve,' Johnson-Thompson said. 'People are not bigging her up too much at all - I hope people big her up because if I had done what she has done I would want people to talk about me in that way. 'I used to think if I was top of my game in every event then no one could beat me but Thiam has better PBs added up than me. I have had to reassess my life a little bit after the 7,000 points she got last year but I do believe I am still able to get PBs. 'I'm looking forward to going against her. She's a great athlete and a really nice person but I know from experience that anything can happen in a heptathlon.'  From her training base in southern France, the confidence for Berlin has only been spoken in muted terms. The calf injury put her behind 'where I wanted to be at the start of the year', but then again she can satisfied with two gold medals by April and a shot at a third in August. 'I'm always going for more,' she said. 'I have not arrived yet so I need to push on.' It will take some shove to dislodge Thiam. Live TV coverage begins on Monday on BBC and British Eurosport."
"It is no secret that both Willian and Anthony Martial are up for grabs this summer, providing the price and the buying club are right. Chelsea and Manchester United both want around £75million for their men, and neither are keen to sell to a domestic rival.  Yet there might be a solution that suits all parties, as reports emerged last week that the clubs are considering a straight swap deal. If that sensational deal comes to pass before Thursday’s 5pm transfer deadline, which club would get the better end of the deal? Sportsmail takes a look at what each player has to offer, and how they compare… Strengths WILLIAN : If Jose Mourinho were able to hand-craft his ideal winger, the result would be something like Willian. He is fast, skilful, direct and possesses a rocket shot – witness his thunderbolts against Barcelona in the Champions League, and any of his many brilliant goals from free-kicks. Oh, and he works, works, works for his team, pressing and tackling from the front. MARTIAL : To see Martial at his very best, look no further than his debut against Liverpool in 2015. Shortly after becoming the world’s most expensive teenager, at £36m, the then 19-year-old put his opponents on their heels with his pace and direct running, bamboozled them with his quick feet, and finished clinically into the bottom corner. Weaknesses WILLIAN: For a player of such talent, Willian’s goal return has never been great. Twenty five in 166 Premier League games for Chelsea - one goal every 6.64 games – is the sort of strike rate that would see other wide forwards, such as Arsenal’s Danny Welbeck, pilloried. His 20 assists also speaks of an unsatisfying end product. £75m is a lot of money for a player who turns 30 this week too. MARTIAL: The Frenchman is blessed with prodigious talent, of that there is no doubt. But the question marks – many of which have been raised by Mourinho – remain over his work-rate and attitude. Although Mourinho’s treatment of Martial’s family situation this summer has been bizarre to say the least, United’s manager will get more understanding from Old Trafford regulars who have been frustrated by the slumped shoulders and resigned air of a player not shy to show his unhappiness with being asked to put a shift in on the wing. Premier League record WILLIAN: As highlighted above, Willian’s goals and assists return is nothing special for a £75m player. The bald statistics say he only scores every 410 minutes and is involved in a goal every 228 minutes – but they also show his ability to impact in other ways. His dribbling puts opponents on the back foot – his dribble success rate of 61.4 per cent is high – and can be the important first step in breaking down an opposing back line. Also his ability to win the ball high up the pitch (165 tackles in total) is crucial for starting counter-attacks. Two league-winner’s medals do not lie, and he has been a key cog in both successful Chelsea sides. MARTIAL: Mixed. Under Louis van Gaal Martial showed such promise; under Mourinho he has drifted to the sidelines. Twenty four goals in 86 games – one every 3.5 games – is very reasonable for a 22-year-old forward – but Martial possesses more talent than your average youngster and the undeniable truth is that he has not made the most of his gifts – yet. United have not come close to the title in his time at the club and will only do so if he –and the likes of Marcus Rashford – improve. No goals in his final 13 games of last season speaks volumes. His ability to take his man on seems to have got worse, not better, and a dribble success rate of 43.2 per cent is low for a wide, fast forward. International record WILLIAN: Firmly established in the Brazil starting XI, his direct style combined so well with Neymar’s flamboyance and Philippe Coutinho’s artistry before Belgium struck a surprise blow in the quarter-finals. Sixty two caps and counting for a player at the height of his powers, although his goal return of eight again speaks of a player whose true ability is not matched on the scoresheet. MARTIAL: Once thought of as the future star of France’s attack, that title has been stolen by the brilliant Kylian Mbappe. After just one goal in 18 games for his country, including a desperately disappointing Euro 2016 on home soil, Didier Deschamps lost patience with Martial and sidelined him amid the rise and rise of Mbappe. They did not miss him a jot in winning the World Cup in Russia despite having a striker in Olivier Giroud who did not score once in the entire tournament. Off the pitch WILLIAN: A devoted family man, Willian is married to Vanessa Martins, with whom he has two daughters. He can be seen on Instagram enjoying the outdoor life, riding jetskis with his brother, playing basketball or enjoying time off at the beach. He also co-owns a London restaurant, Babbo, with Chelsea team-mate David Luiz. MARTIAL: Another proud father, Martial’s son Swan was born last month, and he flew home to be with his partner, Melanie da Cruz, for what he said was a difficult birth. In light of that, his insistence on staying with his young family seems entirely understandable, and makes Mourinho’s claim that Martial should have returned to United’s US tour seem heartless. Martial also has a daughter, Peyton, with his ex-wife, Samantha. Their split in April 2016, which led to some bitter words in public, was claimed by some to have resulted in a dip in his form for United. Verdict Mourinho might just think that a straight swap suits him down to the ground – he gets a proven player of title-winning pedigree in Willian, who would immediately improve United in the wide areas, both in an attacking and defensive sense, and who he knows he can trust. The Portuguese would also be happy to be rid of Martial, whose unhappiness is clear and whose work-rate is never going to impress a hard taskmaster such as Mourinho. In the short-term, Willian’s departure would also surely weaken Chelsea, a direct rival for trophies. But the swap might not go down quite so well among United’s bean-counters. At 30 years old this week, Willian comes at a big price while, at just 22, Martial’s value could yet still sky-rocket if he manages to unlock that undoubted potential. Chelsea may also take the view that Willian’s exit would weaken one area of their team but strengthen another in desperate need of reinforcements. Neither Giroud nor Alvaro Morata appear viable centre forwards for a title-winning team, and signing Martial could see United hand Chelsea a top-class centre forward on a plate for the next decade.  "
"Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri opened the door to Thibaut Courtois joining Real Madrid this summer when he insisted he 'only wanted players who wanted to play here' following the Community Shield defeat by Manchester City.  The Belgian has long flirted with the idea of returning to Madrid, where he featured for three seasons with Atletico and where his family still reside. But Real's current No 1 Keylor Navas has just clinched his third Champions League medal and the Spanish giants have yet to make contact with Chelsea over the Courtois deal.  Here, Sportsmail ask whether Madrid are finally ready to complete the transfer and add a top-class goalkeeper to their star-studded squad this summer.  Do Madrid still want him? Curiously they don’t have a goalkeeping crisis by any stretch of the imagination. New signing Andriy Lunin is impressing everyone on the US tour. The 19-year-old will go out on loan if Courtois turns up but he has shown enough to convince some at the Bernabeu that if he had to stay as No 2 to Navas, he could. Navas meanwhile has been polishing his third Champions League medal this summer and has no intention of leaving. However, Madrid still see getting Courtois for around £36million as very good business and want to get this deal over the line. Do Chelsea want to sell? Better to cash-in now than lose him for free next summer you would think. Although that depends entirely on getting a top replacement.  There is no point having money in the bank if Chelsea have to face the new season with Willy Caballero and Robert Green in goal. Chelsea want Jordan Pickford but Everton have no intention of selling. Chelsea could make a move for Atletico Madrid's Jan Oblak and could even offer Courtois to Atletico in part-exchange. After all, Courtois says his main motivation for moving is missing his children who live in Madrid… That would be some deal for Chelsea. There are few better goalkeepers in the world than Oblak. However Atletico would not want to lose the Slovenian and it would be a very hard sell to the player himself – this could be a special season for Atletico with the Champions League final in their home stadium next May. Oblak might not want to swap Diego Simeone for Sarri. So Chelsea are stuck for a replacement… Barcelona’s Jasper Cillessen has also been mentioned. He would suit Sarri’s preference for someone who can play the ball out with his feet – his superb assist in the Copa del Rey final showed that. Barcelona have lined up Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet should they lose their No 2 but as yet Chelsea have not bitten. So Chelsea could stick with Courtois and lose him for nothing then? That’s not the impression that Sarri gave. He wants players who are committed, Courtois might not be next season.  So the next move from Madrid? They have to talk to Chelsea. In this post tapping-up era deals are done with players long before the clubs are involved and there is agreement between Courtois and Madrid save a few details. It’s Chelsea that the Spanish club’s chief executive Jose Angel Sanchez will have to negotiate with this week. Will the signing of Courtois satisfy the Madrid fans who have seen their club save their money so far this summer? So far there are no calls for them to go into the market. Madrid-supporting media have cranked up a campaign for the club to sign a No 9 but Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio filled the position well in the 3-1 win over Juventus so, even there, there is no clamour for a huge investment. The Madrid board think Eden Hazard is over-priced and plays in a position that they have well covered. The supporters seem to agree. And if Courtois signs he will be No 1 won’t he? Good question. Navas is popular with supporters and team-mates. And he is adamant he will not leave this summer. It may be that Navas gets the Champions League and Courtois plays in La Liga, just for this coming season. Barcelona did something similar when they first signed Marc Andre ter Stegen and he had to share the keeper's jersey with Claudio Bravo."
"Sergio Aguero reached the 200-goal milestone for Manchester City with his strike against Chelsea in Sunday's Community shield. The Argentina striker wrote himself into City's history books by becoming their record goalscorer with his strike against Napoli in the Champions League back in November, which broke Eric Brook's 77-year record.  And now he's joined the elite 200-club, Sportsmail counts down the 10 very best goals Aguero has scored in a City shirt since his arrival in July 2011. A trait that marks Aguero out as one of the Premier League's most deadly strikers is his willingness to pull the trigger early to take goalkeepers by surprise. Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, with City 1-0 down, Aguero demonstrated brilliant awareness by timing his run perfectly in behind Gary Cahill and John Terry to latch onto Javi Garcia's through-ball.  Without taking a touch and without even looking up, Aguero fired a rasping effort into the top corner with his weaker left foot, catching Petr Cech unprepared and equalising for the away side. Though City would go on to lose the match 2-1 with a rare Fernando Torres Chelsea goal settling the contest, Aguero's strike left the away supporters with a memorable moment to take with them back to Manchester.   City's Argentine strike partnership of Aguero and Carlos Tevez combined to devastating effect at Carrow Road as they bagged five between them putting feeble Norwich to the sword. Aguero's first and City's second saw him strolling into Norwich territory before touching on to his compatriot with a flick of his right boot. Tevez returned the favour with a clever back-heel and Aguero finished with aplomb by walloping home a bouncing ball into the top corner from the edge of the area. An outstanding finish from an incredibly tight angle that demonstrated the Argentine's unerring accuracy in front of goal. Kevin De Bruyne's through-ball made its way to Raheem Sterling but Tom Heaton made a brave, lunging save to dispossess the England winger.  Heaton picked himself up and dived at Aguero's feet but the striker still managed to rifle home with his right foot from an improbable angle despite two Burnley defenders positioning themselves on the goal-line. His shot flew past Michael Keane, ricocheted off the post and struck a dumb-founded Matt Lowton on its way in as 10-man City went 2-0 up.  Another goal scored from a tough angle, Aguero bagged his hat-trick against Watford at Vicarage Road in some style. Having netted twice in the first half, Aguero collected the ball around 30 yards out from goal with nine minutes remaining and City already four goals up. He surged past two defenders and bamboozled another two using a clever in-out skill with his right foot, waiting for Heurelho Gomes to go to ground before tucking home past the helpless Watford stopper. Aguero had already bagged two hat-tricks during the 2017-18 season before this four-goal haul against Leicester. The Argentine had helped himself to a second-half treble via a simple tap-in, a powerful effort which was too hot for Kasper Schmeichel to handle and a neat chip after a mistake from the goalkeeper.  But Aguero saved his best for last. And in the final minute he was given too much space on the edge of the area and punished Leicester by smashing an unstoppable effort past Schmeichel that clipped the underside of the crossbar on it's way in. Aguero arrived at City from Atletico Madrid for £32million in the summer of 2011 and quickly set about repaying that then-club-record fee. Having been introduced as a second-half substitute, Aguero opened his account for the club just nine minutes into his debut by tapping home at the far post.  But it was in the 85th minute that Aguero truly announced himself on the Premeir League stage with a stunning second to put City four goals up. Aguero collected possession 30 yards out from goal and unleashed a dipping, swerving effort which flew into the side-netting past a helpless Michel Vorm to cap off a dream debut and down newly-promoted Swansea. Yet another Aguero goal scored from an incredibly tight angle salvaged a point for City in this home Premier League clash in February 2013. City were trailing 2-1 to Steven Gerrard's thumping effort when an aimless ball forward was hunted down by the tireless Aguero.  Martin Skrtel looked to have shepherded Aguero to the edge of the box but Pepe Reina then needlessly charged off his line to meet the striker. Aguero took a touch with his thigh, taking the ball even further away from goal before squeezing home a right-footed effort just inside the far post to leave Liverpool's defence stunned and Reina with egg on his face. Overshadowed slightly by Robert Lewandowski's five goals in nine minutes just days earlier, Aguero's five in 20 minutes against Newcastle was a remarkable feat.   Incredibly Aguero's first of the afternoon, scored just before the interval to bring City level, had ended the striker's run of 595 minutes without a goal in open play. But after the interval the floodgates well and truly opened as Aguero rediscovered his form in spectacular fashion with four further goals scored in quick succession. The best of the five-star display was his fourth. Aguero clipped the ball over Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul with a stylish dink from the edge of the area after a slick passing move involving De Bruyne, Fernandinho and David Silva. Aguero would have fancied his chances of becoming the first player to score six goals in a Premier League game but his manager Manuel Pellegrino ruthlessly hauled him off in just the 66th minute. A brilliant strike which left Manchester United's defenders looking completely dumbfounded and produced a signature Phil Jones expression.  After collecting Yaya Toure's pass, Aguero led United's backline on a merry dance with a mazy run which took him from outside the area to the six-yard box with four touches of his right foot. And with his fifth touch, substitute Aguero demonstrated remarkable balance to get his shot off and rifle home into the roof of the net past David De Gea.  The 78th-minute winner at Old Trafford wasn't enough to haul City back into the 2012/13 Premier League title race but it earned Roberto Mancini's team a satisfying victory in the Manchester derby.   The most iconic and most important goal in Premier League history, No 1 on the list could only be Aguero's title-winning strike in May 2012.  Relegation-threatened QPR were 2-1 up heading into stoppage time and the title was slipping painfully from City's grasp and into the hands of United.   City hauled themselves level with a header from Edin Dzeko but still needed another to secure the club's first title since 1968. Cue Aguero bailing his side out and clinching the Premier League title in the most climactic end to a top-flight season in the modern era. In the dying seconds of added time, amid a feverish atmosphere at the Etihad, Aguero proved the calmest man in the stadium when his team needed him most. The striker picked up the ball 30 yards out and flicked a pass inside to Mario Balotelli before running on to the return, knocking it past a defender and firing home. 'Agueroooooooooo,' screamed Martin Tyler on the Sky Sports commentary. 'I swear you'll never see anything like this ever again. So watch it, drink it in.' "
