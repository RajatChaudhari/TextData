       "{0: \"no wonder jose mourinho is worried about the start of the new season. four days to go until it kicks off at old trafford and he is still waiting for the real manchester united to turn up. this has been a strange, disjointed few weeks for mourinho and his players, and it showed as they completed their pre-season on a muggy night in munich. on this evidence, whatever team united put out on friday night will struggle to overcome leicester never mind challenge manchester city's dominance of the premier league. bayern munich (3-4-3): neuer; kimmich (rudy 72), sule, hummels (boateng 46), alaba (bernat 56); martinez; robben, muller, thiago (rafinha 60), ribery; gnabry. subs: ulreich, hoffmann, lewandowski, boateng, goretzka, coman, mai, zylla, franzke. booked: boateng scorer: martinez 59 man utd (4-3-3): de gea (grant 78); darmian (jones 65), bailly (smalling 51), lindelof (tuanzebe 78), shaw (mitchell 78); herrera (garner 81), pereira, fred (chong 78); mata (mctominay 65), rashford (fosu-mensah 65), sanchez.\\xa0 subs: greenwood. referee: robert hartmann after city gave another demonstration of what they can do at wembley, united looked every bit a team that is coming together in drips and drabs. marcus rashford returned for more than an hour here, officially inheriting the no.10 shirt vacated by zlatan ibrahimovic, while phil jones and victor lindelof also played for the first time since the world cup. but there was still no paul pogba, no romelu lukaku, no jesse lingard, no ashley young and no marouane fellaini. nemanja matic and antonio valencia are injured. anthony martial and marcos rojo were left at home when united flew to germany, casting further doubt over their futures at old trafford, and eric bailly limped off early in the second half. a new centre-half remains the priority and mourinho is banking on united chief ed woodward delivering one. united were reported to have stepped up their interest in harry maguire with a £75million bid on sunday night as leicester continue to resist. it's understood that jerome boateng – a half-time substitute for bayern here – is emerging as another strong possibility even though he would cost £50m and turns 30 next month. asked about boateng, mourinho said: 'my ceo knows what i want for quite a long time, i know he tries to do the best for me and i still have a few days to wait to see what happens.' otherwise, the united boss is preparing to make the most out of the players he has available against leicester. 'we were unlucky to get the friday game so monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday is not enough,' he added. 'we have to organise the week in a way that we can arrive fresh for friday because friday starts the premier league and we play for points and friday is the players we have. 'there is no time to cry for the players that are not going to be. on friday we go with the best possible team.' united look anything but the finished article and it's hard to see how they can click into gear in four days after such a fragmented preparation. they were under the cosh throughout here and david de gea made first half saves from thiago alcantara and serge gnabry. however, he was beaten in the 59th minute when javi martinez rose to score with a glancing header from thiago's corner, a timely reminder perhaps of united's need for an upgrade in central defence. manuel neuer did not have a single save to make and mourinho ended the game by sending on the kids and third-choice keeper lee grant. maybe it was a message to woodward. their strained relationship could deteriorate even further if there isn't a new addition through the door by 5pm on thursday. peter kenyon, the former united and chelsea chief executive who played a key role in mourinho's appointment at stamford bridge in 2004, has been there before and claimed on sunday that the 55-year-old portuguese coach can still make it work. but he warned: 'united is bigger than anybody, bigger than any individual and that's always been the mantra.'\\xa0\",\n",
       " 1: \"premier league clubs are facing a last minute panic as they aim to complete their transfer dealings before the season starts on friday.\\xa0 that leaves clubs in england with only four days in which to do their business, and there is plenty left to be resolved. sportsmail\\xa0brings you all the latest news and done deals throughout the day from 8am to 8pm, so you will not need to go anywhere else. if you are using the app, please click here to view today’s live blog.\\xa0 mina had been heavily linked with a switch to united, who are eager to bring in another centre-back. however, the colombia international is instead edging towards joining everton, where he would become the fourth arrival at goodison park in this transfer window following the signings of richarlison, joao virginia and mina's former barcelona team-mate lucas digne. for more info, click on simon's story here.\",\n",
       " 2: \"the new premier league season has finally arrived, and with it comes the hopes and expectations of many. manchester city are hot favourites to continue their dominance under pep guardiola, while newcomers wolves and fulham have set down early markers with their aggressive approach to the transfer market. sportsmail's resident expert peter crouch gives his team-by-team guide for the campaign ahead.\\xa0 how strange will it be in their first match against manchester city when the camera switches to the dugout and arsene wenger is not there?\\xa0 wenger is all some people know of arsenal and it is going to take everyone time to adjust. i do feel that change will be for the better, certainly in terms of the atmosphere at the emirates. it had become toxic with so many wanting wenger to go and it affected the players.\\xa0 during stoke’s game in april it felt like the home crowd were desperate to turn on him. it will be fascinating to see how unai emery gets on. he has been linked with jobs here before but with his pedigree he was always going to pick a top opportunity.\\xa0 the squad he inherited is good and he’s made some\\xa0interesting buys. i don’t expect to see them pushing for the title. they are still a good way short of the teams that set the standard. the realistic aim is trying to get back into the top four. how will they fare? no title push but definite prospects of finishing in the top four. major ins lucas torreira (sampdoria, £25m) bernd leno (b leverkusen, £20m) sokratis (dortmund, £17m) matteo guendouzi (lorient, £8m) stephan lichtsteiner (juventus, free)\\xa0 major outs jack wilshere (west ham, free) santi cazorla (released) per mertesacker (retired)\\xa0 the first thing you have to say when discussing bournemouth is what a magnificent achievement it is for them to be looking at a fourth consecutive campaign in the top flight.\\xa0 when you\\xa0look at the size of the vitality stadium, it really isn’t geared up for the premier league. eddie howe has done a tremendous job and has enhanced his reputation.\\xa0 you have to admire the way they play football and, to give him full credit, he has remained loyal to his principles when the easiest thing would be to just try to get results. each time they have looked in trouble, they have found a way to get out. but i have a feeling bournemouth are going to find things difficult this season. there were a few bad teams in the premier league last time and that helped them when they had a poor run.\\xa0 will\\xa0they get away with it this time? i’m not sure. it’s not like they haven’t spent money, either, and you would be looking for some of those who have arrived for decent fees to produce. it is going be a long season for them. how will they fare?\\xa0 it will be touch and go whether they can stay up. major ins david brooks (sheffield utd, £12m) diego rico (leganes, £10.7m)\\xa0 major outs benik afobe (wolves, £10m) lewis grabban (nottm forest, £5m) max gradel (toulouse, £1.8m) adam federici (stoke, undisclosed) there were so many brilliant stories last season that brighton’s achievement of staying up didn’t get the recognition it deserved. but here they are, looking forward to another crack at the premier league.\\xa0 my admiration for chris hughton, architect of their campaign, continues to grow. i go back a long way with chris, who was my youth coach at tottenham.\\xa0he has gone on to prove himself a superb manager, first at newcastle and then norwich.\\xa0 the players he has bought have fitted in well and i really like their centre backs, shane duffy and lewis dunk. they don’t mess about, they get the job done and can play when it is required - just like the team as a whole.\\xa0 it always gets said that the second season is the most difficult for teams who come out of the\\xa0championship but i’m pretty sure they will keep on surprising people. how will they fare?

nobody would have predicted that. what a magnificent achievement. they remind me of how stoke were at one point, with a team full of honest professionals all working for each other. they are going to find the demands put on them because of the europa league taxing, when you have to go away to strange places on a thursday and then play again on a sunday. it was a problem for us in 2011-2012 and tony pulis took the decision to leave key players at home for league matches. but having worked so hard to get into europe, sean — who is clever and knows how to get results — will want them to do it properly. i don’t think they will match their seventh-placed finish but i’m confident they will be in the top 10 once again. how will they fare?

the best business they could have made this summer was securing harry kane  to a new long-term deal and that was mission accomplished. initially my concern for them would be the fact they had nine players involved in the world cup semi-finals and there could be a slight hangover. if you don’t have a proper pre-season, you have to play catch up and it leads to early sluggishness. but i don’t have any worries about how they will perform over the campaign as a whole. mauricio pochettino is a fantastic manager and the squad continues to improve. if they can add jack grealish before the deadline, he has the potential to get into the england squad. how will they fare?

and evidence that others were emerging to push them and keep momentum rolling by injecting freshness. here it was, pretty much all of the above. albeit against a team with their best players missing and clearly lots of groundwork still to be done by maurizio sarri. the new chelsea manager, just over three weeks into the job, wants to see his team play with speed and adventure akin to manchester city but they are far from the same levels of fluency and understanding. sergio aguero looked sleek and keen as he erased the memories of what was a most miserable world cup. aguero helped himself to a goal in each half. the first took his city tally to 200 and there might have been a hat-trick without a strong performance from his argentina teammate willy caballero in goal for chelsea.\\xa0 he took the man of the match award from the sponsors and yet those who were at wembley will recall this as they day they saw phil foden begin to transform his huge potential into something more tangible.\\xa0 at 18, foden dazzled and received a standing ovation when he was replaced, having succumbed to cramp, 15 minutes from time. his jinking runs punctured holes in chelsea’s defence, his touch was sure and his passes were crisp and accurate, like the one which found aguero on the edge of the penalty area for the opening goal. aguero feinted to go one way, twisted the other and was afforded the time to slam the ball low past antonio rudiger’s attempted block and the dive of caballero.\\xa0 another explosive change of pace from foden in the first half left jorginho trailing as he cut through the centre and found riyad mahrez in space. mahrez was betrayed by his touch, which offered a reminder of the technical polish which is now the norm at city. when a player fails to stop the ball with precision and poise, it simply jars with the rhythm.\\xa0 foden and bernardo silva, who started out in the roles normally occupied by david silva and kevin de bruyne, were sublime, with such vision and awareness of others around them and maturity and confidence in their decisions. bernardo was shifted out wide after the interval to equal effect and received special praise from guardiola for his display, which the manager thought proved him to be ahead of the other creative players in his squad. foden picked out another aguero run, early in the second half and the striker skipped around the goalkeeper only to slice a shot into the side-netting. it was bernardo who created his second. the striker dashed away from rudiger and behind david luiz to apply a low finish to a perfectly weighed pass. chelsea wilted in the heat where city did not. they have players still to return, including n’golo kante and eden hazard, their two most important under antonio conte. even so, sarri had plenty of occupy his thoughts as he paced the touchline chewing furiously on the gum he has chosen to replace the cigarettes. jorginho was the signing he wanted above all others, the key to setting the tempo and dictating the style he craves. he was stolen from under city’s noses but brazil-born italian international was hustled out of his stride as he took risks on the ball, sitting deep in midfield, on the toes of his central defenders.\\xa0 \\xa0 aguero has now scored 10 goals against chelsea for city. this is only bettered by the 14 he's netted against newcastle.\\xa0 one misplaced pass allowed leroy sane to burst clear midway through the first half and caballero dashed from his line to smother the chance. up front, 17-year-old callum hudson-odoi flickered and threatened from the left and forced an error from claudio bravo with a shot which skidded off the turf and surprised the ‘keeper. bravo escaped another misjudgement, this time beaten by the bounce of a long punt forward from marcos alonso, and chelsea rarely looked capable of testing him with anything more deliberate. alvaro morata offered nothing to suggest a change of manager and a change of shirt number was about to bring him a change of fortune in blue.\\xa0 morata started his chelsea career by missing a penalty in a shoot-out in last year’s community shield before his first season drifted away into disappointment. here, he went off in a blur of substitutions as the fa cup winners were saved from the realms of humiliation by caballero’s defiance. there would be no hat-trick for aguero but there was an ominous purr to the champions. \\xa0\",\n",

       " 9: \"when gareth southgate officially returns to work on monday morning, the video of phil foden's wembley performance will offer him the perfect antidote to those holiday blues. gushing with poise and maturity beyond his 18 years, foden strode around the hallowed turf like he'd been playing there for years. if all goes according plan, wembley will become a second home for this supremely talented central midfielder. southgate is convinced foden can be the lynchpin of england's engine room for years to come; judging by his work in the community shield he's spot on. england's unforgettable run to the world cup semi-final was unforgettable - but it's in the past. southgate will reiterate that message when he reports for duty on monday. the future is euro 2020 and beyond; the england manager believes foden will be key to that future being a successful one. so too could callum hudson-odoi, who provided promising glimpses of why he's being labelled as the best of chelsea's emerging academy talent on sunday. foden and hudson-odoi were the heartbeat of england's under 17 world cup winning side in india last year. on sunday, foden looked better equipped to take the final step into senior football. his piercing run through the heart of chelsea's defence before assisting sergio aguero to put manchester city ahead was unerring. the way he lured david luiz into making a play for the ball before releasing to his argentine colleague the key to city's opener. he put another chance on a plate for aguero at the start of the second half only for the south american to squander. but it wasn't just those killer passes. it was more. so much more. for instance, there was a moment in the second half when goalkeeper claudio bravo pinged a pass out to foden. deep inside his own half, the manner in which foden handled the situation was, arguably, far more impressive than his contribution to city's opener. an exemplary first touch, a quick look up before effortlessly side-stepping ross barkley to find a team-mate. not a hint of panic. in a snapshot, foden embodied exactly what southgate - and pep guardiola - are looking for: the ability to retain possession under any circumstance. 'we cry out for this every year, young, english players to be given a chance at top teams. phil foden, there is a great season, hopefully, for him ahead,' former england captain rio ferdinand said on sunday. 'england, what they lacked was that creativity, a bit of imagination, he has that in abundance, and we want to see him bring that to the premier league.' there are, of course, bigger tests to follow for foden. but as the curtain-raised on another season, it was one of english football's most promising talents that left us purring with excitement. finally, england look to have a ball-playing central midfield capable of living up to the hype. we've been here before. jack wilshere, josh mceachran and john bostock would all testify to that. indeed, their is a lingering fear for foden - and southgate - over the amount of football guardiola is willing to afford his teenager over next nine months. foden is far too good for academy and reserve level football. he may only be 18 - but he's outgrown junior football. he looks slight and scrawny but make no mistake - foden is ready for the big time. it's a situation guardiola must handle with care, but you'd back the spaniard to call it correctly. 'he was ready last season, now he is one year more mature. he trained for all last year with us, and it is so good to have another player with his talents,' guardiola said after sunday's win. 'he is a manchester city fan, a mancunian, and that is why he is so good.' foden left the field to a standing ovation. more performances like this and he'd better get used to it.\",\n",

       " 12: \"sergio aguero reached the 200-goal milestone for manchester city with his strike against chelsea in sunday's community shield. the argentina striker wrote himself into city's history books by becoming their record goalscorer with his strike against napoli in the champions league back in november, which broke eric brook's 77-year record.\\xa0 and now he's joined the elite 200-club, sportsmail counts down the 10 very best goals aguero has scored in a city shirt since his arrival in july 2011. a trait that marks aguero out as one of the premier league's most deadly strikers is his willingness to pull the trigger early to take goalkeepers by surprise. against chelsea at stamford bridge, with city 1-0 down, aguero demonstrated brilliant awareness by timing his run perfectly in behind gary cahill and john terry to latch onto javi garcia's through-ball.\\xa0 without taking a touch and without even looking up, aguero fired a rasping effort into the top corner with his weaker left foot, catching petr cech unprepared and equalising for the away side. though city would go on to lose the match 2-1 with a rare fernando torres chelsea goal settling the contest, aguero's strike left the away supporters with a memorable moment to take with them back to manchester.\\xa0\\xa0 city's argentine strike partnership of aguero and carlos tevez combined to devastating effect at carrow road as they bagged five between them putting feeble norwich to the sword. aguero's first and city's second saw him strolling into norwich territory before touching on to his compatriot with a flick of his right boot. tevez returned the favour with a clever back-heel and aguero finished with aplomb by walloping home a bouncing ball into the top corner from the edge of the area. an outstanding finish from an incredibly tight angle that demonstrated the argentine's unerring accuracy in front of goal. kevin de bruyne's through-ball made its way to raheem sterling but tom heaton made a brave, lunging save to dispossess the england winger.\\xa0 heaton picked himself up and dived at aguero's feet but the striker still managed to rifle home with his right foot from an improbable angle despite two burnley defenders positioning themselves on the goal-line. his shot flew past michael keane, ricocheted off the post and struck a dumb-founded matt lowton on its way in as 10-man city went 2-0 up.\\xa0 another goal scored from a tough angle, aguero bagged his hat-trick against watford at vicarage road in some style. having netted twice in the first half, aguero collected the ball around 30 yards out from goal with nine minutes remaining and city already four goals up. he surged past two defenders and bamboozled another two using a clever in-out skill with his right foot, waiting for heurelho gomes to go to ground before tucking home past the helpless watford stopper. aguero had already bagged two hat-tricks during the 2017-18 season before this four-goal haul against leicester. the argentine had helped himself to a second-half treble via a simple tap-in, a powerful effort which was too hot for kasper schmeichel to handle and a neat chip after a mistake from the goalkeeper.\\xa0 but aguero saved his best for last. and in the final minute he was given too much space on the edge of the area and punished leicester by smashing an unstoppable effort past schmeichel that clipped the underside of the crossbar on it's way in. aguero arrived at city from atletico madrid for £32million in the summer of 2011 and quickly set about repaying that then-club-record fee. having been introduced as a second-half substitute, aguero opened his account for the club just nine minutes into his debut by tapping home at the far post.\\xa0 but it was in the 85th minute that aguero truly announced himself on the premeir league stage with a stunning second to put city four goals up. aguero collected possession 30 yards out from goal and unleashed a dipping, swerving effort which flew into the side-netting past a helpless michel vorm to cap off a dream debut and down newly-promoted swansea. yet another aguero goal scored from an incredibly tight angle salvaged a point for city in this home premier league clash in february 2013. city were trailing 2-1 to steven gerrard's thumping effort when an aimless ball forward was hunted down by the tireless aguero.\\xa0 martin skrtel looked to have shepherded aguero to the edge of the box but pepe reina then needlessly charged off his line to meet the striker. aguero took a touch with his thigh, taking the ball even further away from goal before squeezing home a right-footed effort just inside the far post to leave liverpool's defence stunned and reina with egg on his face. overshadowed slightly by robert lewandowski's five goals in nine minutes just days earlier, aguero's five in 20 minutes against newcastle was a remarkable feat.\\xa0\\xa0 incredibly aguero's first of the afternoon, scored just before the interval to bring city level, had ended the striker's run of 595 minutes without a goal in open play. but after the interval the floodgates well and truly opened as aguero rediscovered his form in spectacular fashion with four further goals scored in quick succession. the best of the five-star display was his fourth. aguero clipped the ball over newcastle goalkeeper tim krul with a stylish dink from the edge of the area after a slick passing move involving de bruyne, fernandinho and david silva. aguero would have fancied his chances of becoming the first player to score six goals in a premier league game but his manager manuel pellegrino ruthlessly hauled him off in just the 66th minute. a brilliant strike which left manchester united's defenders looking completely dumbfounded and produced a signature phil jones expression.\\xa0 after collecting yaya toure's pass, aguero led united's backline on a merry dance with a mazy run which took him from outside the area to the six-yard box with four touches of his right foot. and with his fifth touch, substitute aguero demonstrated remarkable balance to get his shot off and rifle home into the roof of the net past david de gea.\\xa0 the 78th-minute winner at old trafford wasn't enough to haul city back into the 2012/13 premier league title race but it earned roberto mancini's team a satisfying victory in the manchester derby.\\xa0\\xa0 the most iconic and most important goal in premier league history, no 1 on the list could only be aguero's title-winning strike in may

'he is a technical player.\\xa0 'he has to improve on the defensive phase, it's difficult to play with jorginho, cesc and ross all together. but i like him. he will be a very useful player for us.' barkley completed the full 90 minutes at wembley, but could not stop his side succumbing to a 2-0 defeat thanks to sergio aguero's double. he will now compete with the likes of jorginho, fabregas and n'golo kante for a place in sarri's usual 4-3-3 system. chelsea and barkley face lyon on tuesday before starting the premier league season away to huddersfield on saturday.\",\n",
       " 18: \"from expensive summer signings to those returning after a standout world cup, all eyes will be on the premier league's big names when the new season kicks off. but which stars should you keep a particular eye on - and why?\\xa0 here,\\xa0sportsmail columnist jamie redknapp picks the 10 players to watch, including liverpool's midfield dynamo and a fulham youngster looking to make his mark.\\xa0 naby keita, 26, liverpool\\xa0 he's a little powerhouse — an all-action hero in midfield. keita has a great touch, will make goals and score them. there is also devilment in his play and that could get him in trouble. we saw that last season when he was sent off four times. when manchester united visit anfield in december, i’m sure they’ll use every trick in the book to try to wind him up! but if he keeps his cool, he can be such an important player. the only time liverpool missed philippe coutinho was against the more stubborn sides when they struggled to unlock the door. keita and fellow arrival fabinho can bring that guile to jurgen klopp’s midfield. max meyer, 22, crystal palace palace have committed a lot of money in terms of wages on the former schalke star. i first saw him play against chelsea in the champions league five years ago. he is a neat and tidy player who is good on the ball but is yet to fulfil his true potential. at 22 there’s plenty of time for him to do so but whether he can at selhurst park remains to be seen. the big challenge for roy hodgson is how to use him. will he sit in a midfield two or play as a no 10? i’m fascinated to see how this move turns out. aaron ramsey, 27, arsenal i'm expecting big things from ramsey this season. unai emery must look at the midfielder and think, 'why haven't arsenal got the best from him?' what emery has to do is give him more direction. there has been no pressure on any of the arsenal players for the last few years under arsene wenger but now each will be given a defined role. emery must tell ramsey that his job is to make late runs into the box and score frank lampard-style goals. he has one year left on his contract and it is vital that emery keeps him at the emirates. start the season in scintillating form and i can see ramsey signing a new long-term deal. jorginho, 26, chelsea it\\xa0is a good sign when a new manager’s first act upon arriving at a club is to bring in a player he has worked with closely. maurizio sarri rates £57million signing jorginho highly and trusts him to be the pass master in chelsea’s midfield. he has a lovely habit of finding a team-mate with practically every pass but he struggled against city at wembley yesterday and will need to get up to speed quickly. if he does, chelsea should have a great balance in midfield with jorginho alonside n’golo kante. they have bundles of energy and will keep the ball well. richarlison, 21, everton when i first saw him play for watford, he was the closest i have seen to a young cristiano ronaldo. i’m not saying that he’s as good as the five-time champions league winner. but i see in richarlison the same attributes the 19-year-old ronaldo possessed when i played against him. the brazilian has blistering pace, is good in the air and loves to take on players. at times he over-elaborates with his tricks and flicks and his critics will point to the fact that he did not score after november. but there is a reason marco silva - who brought him to watford this time last year - has paid £44million to take him from his old club. that may seem a lot of money now but if richarlison fulfils his potential, it could prove a bargain. everton’s new manager knows that if he can dig beneath the surface, he can strike gold. ruben neves, 21, wolves this player is central to everything wolves do. he was their outstanding player in their promotion campaign and i’m confident he will make the step up to the premier league. neves likes to dictate games from midfield but he may find it tricky at first. he will not be afforded the same space he was given in the championship. he was a showman last season - scoring six times from outside of the box - and i am sure we will see more of those magic moments. nuno espirito santo has built a strong squad at molineux and i don’t think they will be in any danger of going down. impress this season and neves could be set for a big move. phil foden, 18, manchester city i really believe this kid can be the future of english football. at the world cup we were crying out for a creative spark in midfield and i hope one day foden can be that player. he and mason mount, who has joined frank lampard’s derby on loan from chelsea, are two of the brightest young prospects in england. pep guardiola has seen enough of foden to want to develop him at city rather than send him on loan. this is a manager who has worked with the likes of xavi and iniesta and that bodes well for foden. this may not be his breakthrough year — it will be hard to displace the midfield geniuses of kevin de bruyne and david silva — but i’d like to see him getting more game time. the fa cup and league cup could be perfect stages on which to shine. jack wilshere, 26, west ham james corden\\xa0is trying to claim the credit for jack going to west ham after he came on a league of their own a few weeks ago! this is a perfect move for him. he is the sort of player who will take the game by the scruff of the neck and conjure moments of magic. the west ham fans should really take to him. of course there will be question marks over his fitness and i have said for a long time that he needs to add more goals and assists to his game. but if he can stay injury free he has a great platform to get back into the england squad. for me this is the most interesting signing of the summer and i’m intrigued to see how he does. paul pogba, 25, manchester united pogba went to the world cup with plenty of questions hanging over him. can he do it in big games? can he score goals? can he be disciplined and play in a midfield two? it’s safe to say he answered every one of his critics as france were crowned world champions. didier deschamps, the france manager, found a way to get the best from him so why can’t jose mourinho? i just feel there is another clash waiting to happen between these two and i find it difficult to see how they can repair their relationship. mourinho has gone with the safe option of making antonio valencia his captain but i’d have given the armband to pogba. by building the team around him, jose would be challenging pogba to prove he is an elite player by delivering captain’s performances every week.\\xa0\\xa0 ryan sessegnon, 18, fulham\\xa0 what strikes me most about sessegnon is that nothing seems to faze him. he is only 18 but has already played 71 games in the championship, scored 20 goals and been shortlisted for pfa young player of the year. when i first watched him at left back i thought that he could be the next ashley cole. now, his transition to left wing reminds me of gareth bale. manager slavisa jokanovic has recognised that a player with such pace and skill can cause more damage high up the pitch. i don’t want to put too much pressure on him but i cannot see why he won’t take to the premier league with the same confidence he has approached his promising career to date. \\xa0\",\n",
       " 19: 'after the most thrilling and unpredictable world cup many of us can remember, the premier league faces an unusual and intriguing challenge. how on earth does it top that? summers can seem long without the ebb and flow of domestic football. wall to wall coverage of the premier league means it has become if not quite the soundtrack to our sporting lives, certainly that friend that is always there for us. maybe it has taken us for granted a little, knowing we will always be around. but on the back of the world cup and england’s prominent role in it, maybe it is time for the premier league to remind us again just what it was that made us fall for it in the first place. and if it can give us one thing this season, then that thing would be a genuine title race. it was impossible to call the outcome of the world cup right until they were about to pull all the bunting down in moscow. but last year wonderful, beguiling manchester city had the title won by christmas while the year before - strange as it sounds now - chelsea were clear winners once antonio conte turned things around. in fact the last time the premier league gave us a true fight to the finish was five seasons ago when liverpool clipped the last hurdle to give manuel pellegrini’s city side victory by two points.\\xa0 that is appropriate because if anybody looks ready to seriously challenge city this time round, then it looks like being the merseyside club. jurgen klopp and his liverpool side know what the standards are. city set them under pep guardiola last season and the champions are unlikely to slip far from that level over the next nine months.\\xa0 liverpool can match city on their day and often have done.\\xa0the challenge now is to find the consistency to stand square with them over the course of a season. jose mourinho was just being jose mourinho last week when he suggested the pressure was on klopp to deliver. the manchester united boss had a point, though.\\xa0 the sale of philippe coutinho — remember him? — has enabled liverpool to back klopp in the market this summer and as a result the liverpool squad has a deeper, more solid look about it now. liverpool will not lack motivation and nor will their manager. this could be a season that sees chelsea and arsenal in transition under new managers while united and tottenham don’t look much stronger than they did last term. so this feels a little like a moment in time for klopp and his players. much will depend on the ability of a new goalkeeper — the brazilian alisson — to settle. during the world cup, the former roma player always looked a little too keen to punch rather than catch.\\xa0 in midfield, meanwhile, fabinho and naby keita will be required to offer their new club some reliability. as prosaic as it sounds, liverpool cannot play as openly as they have under klopp so far if they are to win things. however, liverpool’s chances probably depend on a familiar face as much as any new arrivals and that face belongs to mo salah.\\xa0 last year’s player of the year will not score the 40-plus goals he did last year. that was a one-off, a magical mixture of perfect form and fitness. it was a season when the stars aligned for the egyptian and if liverpool are to leap from fourth to first and make up a 25-point gap on city then he must lead from the front again. city have added riyad mahrez to their squad and have numerous other players who we can expect to improve this time. benjamin mendy is fit again and john stones and kyle walker will be better, more mature players thanks to their world cup experience. liverpool and the rest must also hope guardiola will be distracted by europe. city will not admit it but the champions league remains the elephant in the room. only a significant drop in standards at the etihad will really give united, arsenal and chelsea a chance in the league while at tottenham, mauricio pochettino will once again wrestle with the issue of how to get a marquee performance out of his gifted team when it really, really matters. elsewhere, this could be the season when we find out whether new everton manager marco silva can get a team to play for more than three or four months and whether west ham have recruited a different manuel pellegrini to the one who spent much of his time at city giving off the distinct impression that he would rather be somewhere else if only he could be guaranteed the same amount of money. we welcome the return to the premier league of one of europe’s brightest and most interesting coaches in slavisa jokanovic and his fulham side should prosper.\\xa0 it is harder to be as optimistic for the other promoted teams wolves and cardiff, while it looks challenging at this juncture to expect anything but relative regression from teams like burnley, leicester, huddersfield, crystal palace and, sadly, newcastle united. bournemouth and brighton may continue to punch upwards at the premier league’s glass ceiling simply because of the quality of the coaching at those clubs and it would be appropriate if that were to be the case. at the top of the premier league, the story may be about a german and a spaniard but the summer has changed the way we view things a little. if ever we should be in the mood to celebrate english management and english football, it is now.

       " 20: \"every monday fans from each of the 20 premier league clubs run the rule over their teams' performances in the verdict. here they analyse the season ahead. and none of them are tipping their team to go down! arsenal peter wood (le grove) biggest hope: unai emery implements a distinct style of play that excites the fans and returns arsenal the glory years of peak wengerball. greatest fear: emery doesn't adapt to the language, his ideas fall flat early on in the season, leading to #wengerin protests in the stands. key player: lucas torreira. our defence has lacked a shield for 10 years, this guy has the mobility, fire and discipline we need. he is a pivotal signing and could prove inspired. one to watch: smith rowe looks an outside bet, but i think my money would be on defensive midfielder guendouzi shining this season. his aggression, acceleration over 10-yards and his portfolio of passing stand him out as a hugely promising 19-year-old. good window? it's been a required window. not much glamour, but if you consider the acquisitions over the last eight months, we've replaced the entire spine. we've hired in know-how, experience and aggression. we're built to make the top four, and that's good enough. away trip you're looking forward to: spurs in their new stadium, march 2. would be special to trounce them. where will you finish: 3rd at best, likely 4th. bournemouth peter bell (cherry chimes) biggest hope: i want to see afc bournemouth get to a cup semi-final or final. we have had several years of getting to quarter-finals and it would be great to get closer to a really big day out. greatest fear: it has to be relegation. bournemouth have to work hard to retain their premier league status and i'm a bit worried that the club has not made many signings. key player: nathan ake is the player who needs to play as many games as possible if bournemouth are to keep the goals against down. i don't think the other players are anywhere near his level. one to watch: we'll be expecting lewis cook to get more games and to start scoring some goals. he could break into teh england team with some good early season performances. good window? the new signings are not big names and it is not clear whether they will be automatic starters. fans haven't turned round at the signings and said wow that is an amazing signing for us. away trip you're looking forward to: newcastle united is the game that is most on my mind as the weekend up in the north east is great fun with the geordie fans who love football. where will you finish: realistically, i'd settle for 14th. brighton simon cox (brighton fans) biggest hope: well, if i am allowed a 'biggest' hope, i'll take european football. realistically, i would like to do the double over palace and repeat or better last season's position. greatest fear: the only fear i have is losing chris hughton. the players are magnificent, but no individual is bigger than the sum of the parts. our manager is our only must stay! key player: very hard to call this one, as pascal gross and mat ryan are both clearly men who quietly get on with doing a magnificent job, and none of the signings are 'superstars', so i will say mat ryan. the moment krul turned up, ryan became world class. one to watch: well, this will be controversial, but i love ezequiel schelotto. he is as mad as a box of frogs, but i believe he brings fun to the game, and he has the ability to cause mayhem! good window? the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, but our scouts operate under the radar and unearth hidden gems. ali jahanbakhsh looks a good signing, and it will be enjoyable finding out who else we have discovered. away trip you're looking forward to: simple. fulham. it was my first ever away trip with my dad. we won. paul clarke goal. it was my first ever away trip with my son. we won. nathan jones fist pumps. say no more. where will you finish: top six! burnley tony scholes (up the clarets) biggest hope: having finished 7th last season and kicked off this season with a europa league game against aberdeen, it would be demanding too much to expect anything better. my hope is that we can continue to build our club as a premier league club. greatest fear: it has to be getting sucked into a relegation battle. we all but avoided it in 2016-17 and were a long way from it last season. i don't see it happening but we must be aware of it and ensure we stay well clear. key player: it's a team game at burnley and so no player is ever more important than the next. if i had to pick any out then it would be the strikers simply because they score the goals that win games. one to watch: there are a couple who have been involved in pre-season, central defender jimmy dunne and midfielder dwight mcneil. both have looked good and both look to have bright futures in the game. good window? at the time of writing we haven't had a transfer window. we haven't bought anyone and we haven't sold anyone. i'm sure that will change in the next week though with maybe two or three new signings. away trip you're looking forward to: the one i'm looking forward to is spurs. it's always good to visit a new stadium and this one looks as though it is going to be worth a visit, unlike the last new stadium now used by west ham. where will you finish: 10th and that will be another good season. cardiff callum ellis (inside wales sport)\\xa0 biggest hope: i hope we can remain competitive throughout the campaign and get a few positive results against the top six, just like we did in the 2013-14 season. greatest fear: after our last premier league outing ended in relegation, the dreaded drop zone is my greatest fear again this season. key player: captain sean morrison led by example last season and managed to score seven goals. he's a key figure in the heart of defence and always poses a threat from set-pieces. one to watch: rhys healey has impressed in pre-season - and i'm sure he will be looking to challenge for a place in the matchday squad this season. good window? overall, it's been a good window with the four additions neil warnock has brought in. josh murphy and bobby reid are both exciting players who will hopefully deliver with goals. away trip you're looking forward to: the opening day trip to the vitality stadium will be one each fan is looking forward to. our long-awaited return to the top flight will bring a real buzz to the travelling bluebirds making the trip to the south coast. where will you finish: 16th chelsea andy seaby (chelsea daft) biggest hope: biggest hope is that chelsea perform better than we did last season. chelsea have made significant changes and they need to come off yet again. greatest fear: biggest fear is that the new manager doesn't succeed and the decision to get rid of a serial winner in conte for someone who has won nothing to date proves to be the wrong one. key player: eden hazard. we have to keep him at the club if we are to challenge for the top four once again. he has become so important for us now that to lose him could be devastating. one to watch: callum hudson-odoi, this kid has some serious talent, fantastic skill and excellent ability at such a young age. whether or not he stays or gets loaned out, he could get involved at some stage this year. good window? bad in my view. just one signing and rob green. the club acted too late to sort the managerial position out and could find themselves out of it when it comes to getting some big deals done if we lose one or two. away trip you're looking forward to: manchester city because we need to banish the unprofessional and outright embarrassing performance there last season. we owe them and that's one i am looking forward to. where will you finish: fourth in my view. if we can make a couple of signings and hold onto eden hazard we could aim higher. its all down to how quickly the players take to sarri-ball. crystal palace jay crame (the eagles beak) biggest hope: a top 10 finish. we are probably a couple of signings away from having a competitive squad of players that would make a challenge for a top half spot but it bottom half of the table is likely to be as tight as it was for most of last season. greatest fear: the dreaded drop. while it is not the end of football that some may consider it to be, it would still be hard to take. it is never a nice feeling and we know that from experience. key player: simple. wilfried zaha. we are not silly enough to think that he will not go on to bigger and better things at some point in the future but one more season in south london will be very welcome indeed. one to watch: tough question. could say aaron wan-bissaka will continue where he left of last season but if we are looking at a breakthrough player, it could be one of sullay kaikai, jason lokilo or nya kirby - if given the opportunity. good window? the signing of max meyer is very exciting and something of a coup for us as he was touted by a nunmber of clubs. do not underestimate the addition of cheikhou kouyate, either. away trip you're looking forward to: fulham - not too far to travel for us of course and craven cottage is one those nicely positioned grounds, right by the thames. there is no doubt that roy hodgson will receive a very good reception from the home fans. where will you finish: 12th everton joel parker (toffee analysis) biggest hope: a good cup run and some actual ambition against the 'top clubs'. far too passive when we face a better side away from home and it needs to be sorted. greatest fear: falling back into last seasons troubles, lack of creativity, no organisation at the back... but surely you can't hit further than rock bottom, right? key player: jordan pickford - brilliant world cup but he was the difference between a respectable league position and big, big trouble. one to watch: kieran dowell - honestly one of the most dangerous left foots i've seen, great from dead ball situations, take-ons and can be a key creative link in marco silva's team. good window? bad - we haven't cleared enough of the deadwood as well as making any major signings who are guaranteed to do well. richarlison does show promise but whether he can reach his £44m price tag is certainly debatable. away trip you're looking forward to: always loved going to craven cottage. where will you finish: 8th fulham russ goldman (cottage talk)\\xa0 biggest hope: my biggest hope for the season is that fulham show the premier league that they have come back to compete, and not just survive. my other hope is that they continue to play the attractive football they showed in the championship. greatest fear: my greatest fear is that if they start slow, and the talk about sacking the manager begins. he is the right head coach for fulham long term, so he could be put under pressure by the media and some fans, if fulham do not get off to a great start. key player: it is tom cairney as the team really has been built around him. when cairney is able to create opportunities for his team-mates, and himself, fulham are a tough team to play against. one to watch: i think it is a no brainer to say it is ryan sessegnon, and i expect him to show why he belongs to play in the premier league right now. what makes him so dangerous is his football instinct to always be at the right place at the right time. good window? so far it has been an excellent transfer window as fulham are showing their intent to compete in this league, by the level of talent they have brought in already. the additions of jean michael seri, and andre schurrle have shown the direction that fulham want to go, and that is nowhere near the relegation positions. away trip you're looking forward to: for this season, i am going to say it is going to be wembley for fulham supporters. it had been so long since fulham have played at wembley, so to get back there again is going to be special. where will you finish: i am going to be bold and say 10th, as the club has serious ambition, and i think fulham's style of play will translate in the premier league very well. huddersfield harry greenwood (better than klopp) biggest hope: our hope yet again has to be to survive, and hopefully more comfortably than last year. anything beyond that is a bonus! greatest fear: the second season syndrome is always a fear. we've got a better squad than last year without a doubt, but we don't have the momentum of promotion anymore. key player: terence kongolo. he came in last year and contributed massively to us staying up. we've paid big money to keep him here, and he'll be crucial if we're to survive again. one to watch: abdelhamid sabiri has looked really sharp in pre season. he's nowhere near the finished article but he's definitely made steps in the right direction. philip billing has improved further and new boy diakhaby looks a good addition. good window? it's been good again. we are maybe one or two players light, but we've bought well, bringing in young, hungry players. wagner has addressed the problem area of the wing positions, and we've managed to offload a few. away trip you're looking forward to: everyone is looking forward to spurs and the new ground this year. fulham and cardiff coming up also adds two more good away days. where will you finish: 15th leicester warwick kay (lcfc world) biggest hope: to reach the fa cup final would be great. greatest fear: we could end up in a relegation battle if we don't hit the ground running. the fans would then get on puel's back as the jury is still out on him - even though we finished 9th. we rely on vardy a lot up front and without the service from mahrez it will be interesting to see how he does. key player: this year it must be harry maguire! one to watch: hopefully hamza choudhury will continue growing after gaining experience last season. good window? so far i'm happy with our transfers. we needed a new right back and maddison looks an exciting prospect in midfield. big shoes to fill with mahrez leaving though. away trip you're looking forward to: looking forward to seeing the brand new spurs ground - looks good! where will you finish: top 10 again. liverpool dave usher (the liverpool way) biggest hope: more of the same. last year's performance level only with some silverware to show for it. greatest fear: i've got so much confidence in this manager and group of players that the only thing that worries me is if we have bad luck with injuries. key player: roberto firmino is the one who makes everything work. mo salah gets most of the headlines while virgil van dijk's importance is widely recognised, but when firmino is on song it makes life easier for everybody. one to watch: naby keita. he's new to the premier league and is relatively unknown outside of liverpool as he was at an unfashionable club and represents a country that never plays at the world cup. those who don't know how good he is are in for a big shock. good window? its been great. the biggest need was addressed when alisson becker arrived. keita is going to be a superstar, fabinho should be an upgrade on emre can and it will be interesting to see how xherdan shaqiri does in a side where he doesn't have to do everything himself. away trip you're looking forward to: everton. it's on our doorstep and it's funny seeing them fume about never being able to beat us regardless of how we play. last year's fixture was a huge inconvenience for jurgen klopp as it was sandwiched between the two man city games in europe, but even with everyone's minds elsewhere everton still couldn't win. where will you finish: second, but if city were to suffer their usual post-title slump, then maybe… manchester city steven allweis (view from a blue) biggest hope: that city can produce the same attacking brilliance that made it so special to watch us last season. greatest fear: that we become a little complacent after breaking all those records last season and allow other teams to catch us. key player: fernandinho. he is absolutely vital to pep's system and the way we play, and we do not have anyone else who can play his role to a similar level. one to watch: phil foden. we have seen glimpses of his potential so far and pep will want to give him more opportunities, especially if we do not bring in other midfielders this window. good window? somewhere in the middle. mahrez is a good signing, the lack of a new holding midfielder is not ideal ... but despite only bringing in one player we have to remember just how far ahead of the rest we were last year. away trip you're looking forward to: a trip to the brighton seaside for the last game of the season could be a fun celebration if the title is wrapped up by then! where will you finish: 1st manchester united sam peoples (the peoples person) biggest hope: challenging for the title. at this point, united fans are worried we won't do that. greatest fear: being out of the running by christmas. key player: pogba. world cup winner and the catalyst to everything good we do. one to watch: lindelof. underwhelming first season, had a great world cup and bailly needs a defensive partner. good window? bad. fred is the only major signing who will make a difference. away trip you're looking forward to: bournemouth. love the stadium and the location where will you finish: 4th newcastle tom bore (read newcastle) biggest hope: a cup run is always what fans, especially of those outside the top six, will be hoping for each season and i am no different. success in either the league or fa cup would be incredible. greatest fear: relegation. despite finishing tenth last season and signing a number of fresh faces this summer, it's hard to not be concerned about relegation - especially with mike ashley at the helm of the club who could force rafa benitez into leaving the club at any moment. key player: club captain jamaal lascelles has to be our most important player. not only is he our strongest player at the heart of the defence, but he is key in the dressing room to ensure the team's heads don't drop at any point this season. one to watch: jamie sterry looks as if he will be featuring plenty for newcastle this season. whilst adam armstrong would typically be the man newcastle fans highlight, sterry deserves recognition for solid performances whilst progressing through the youth ranks. good window? many fans will disagree with me on this and i completely understand due to the money spent compared to our premier league rivals, but i believe this window has been a success. we have improved on the squad we had last year, replacing any departing players with those that rafa benitez wanted and those that will fit the system he is looking to deploy. away trip you're looking forward to: wolves. i have been desperate for a return ever since my last visit and am eagerly anticipating my trip to molineux this season. where will you finish: 10th-12th southampton sam cox (fresh saints) biggest hope: my hope for the season is that we can put last seasons failure of a campaign behind us and push for a top-half finish. hopefully mark hughes can bring fast-paced attacking football back to st mary's, following two underwhelming seasons under claude puel and mauricio pellegrino. greatest fear: relegation. southampton were one defeat to swansea away from going down last season, due to a lack of freedom and creativity in the final third. two months on and i'm still wondering where the goals are going to come from... key player: jannik vestergaard will prove to be saints' most important player this season. hughes paid £18m for the 6ft 6in centre back to provide the defensive stability that was non-existent last season. his physical approach to the game and natural ability on the ball will hopefully help to fill the van dijk shaped hole in our defence. one to watch: southampton are renowned for unearthing young talents and developing them into world stars. this season we may see the emergence of academy duo josh sims and harrison reed. sims has shown glimpses of quality in an injury-plagued career so far, while reed was a mainstay in norwich's midfield last season, during a year-long loan spell at carrow road. good window? overall, i would have to say saints' transfer window so far has been a success. we've strengthened in positions that let us down last season, invested in the future and thrown away the deadwood. the additions of mohammed elyounoussi and jannik vestergaard have been particularly pleasing. away trip you're looking forward to: for southampton fans, the best away trips are the two east and west of the south coast to bournemouth and brighton. all three of us were fighting for league one promotion during the 2010-11 season, and our fixtures have been fiery ever since. where will you finish: i don't think saints will be pulling up any trees this season and as a result i predict saints to finish 11th. after last seasons relegation rollercoaster, i think most saints fans will be happy with that. tottenham barnaby slater biggest hope: i hope that we continue to improve as we have done over the past few seasons with pochettino at the helm. how we take to our beautiful new stadium will be all important, but there's no reason why we shouldn't make it a fortress, seeing as we were hard to beat at wembley where the atmosphere was average at best. a trophy would be fantastic, and in a strange way i think the champions league may be our best chance of one as last season we showed that we can be a real force in that competition. greatest fear: a bad start as a result of our world cup semi-finalists coming back late and tired, compounded by the need to play catch up for the rest of the season, something that would be near enough impossible, especially considering the amount of money our nearest challengers have spent over the summer to improve their squads. key player: christian eriksen. i know this will surprise many as harry kane is the obvious choice, but i genuinely feel eriksen would be the hardest player for us to replace. he is our one player who can unlock the door and without him i worry where a lot of harry kane's chances would come from. one to watch: as much as i'd like to say marcus edwards, it seems like his ship has sailed. kyle walker-peters started two premier league games last season and was man of the match in both. he has a real chance of becoming second choice lb/lwb behind ben davies if, as expected, danny rose departs this summer. i also feel he is less of a risk as reserve rb/rwb than serge aurier, who is still a bit too much of a maverick for my liking. good window? both so far. no money spent so far is winding up a lot of the spurs fanbase. however, we need to ship out some of the deadwood in our squad such as sissoko, vincent janssen and fernando llorente. on the plus side we've signed some of our most important players to new, long contracts - so that's a positive. away trip you're looking forward to: arsenal. time for us to beat them at the emirates for just the second time. where will you finish: first, second, third or fourth. if i were a betting man, which i am, i'd say third behind man city and liverpool. watford david anderson (golden pages fanzine) biggest hope: my biggest hope for the season is to see us continue to play well after christmas. every year since our promotion in 2015, we've started well but dropped off in the second half of the season. hopefully we can have a stable full season under javi gracia and avoid this dip. greatest fear: more managerial instability would be my greatest fear, whether this be gracia performing well and having his head turned, or him performing badly and his position being questioned. a full, stable season with one head coach in charge would be lovely. key player: abdoulaye doucoure, who has just signed a new five-year deal, will undoubtedly by a key player again this year in midfield. however, whether doucoure stays or goes, the return of nathaniel chalobah from injury will be huge for us. one to watch: chalobah and will hughes are obvious answers, but new signing ben wilmot is really one to watch. he's impressed in pre-season since signing from stevenage and it's nice to have a local lad pushing for a first team place. good window? i would have to say good, so far. losing richarlison was a blow, but at £44m it was too good an offer to turn down. i'm more than happy with the permanent signing of gerard deulofeu to replace the brazilian. ben foster returning also feels like a bit of a coup, and we've strengthened in depth with a few cheap signings in the wide areas too. away trip you're looking forward to: fulham, without a doubt. craven cottage is full of character and in a lovely position right on the thames. it's a pleasure to have them back in the top flight. plus i have good memories there as a watford fan, which certainly helps. where will you finish: 15th west ham michael oliver (read west ham) biggest hope: as a west ham fan, i try and keep as realistic as possible. you won't find me waxing lyrical about how we're going to mount a big charge on the european places, all i hope for is that the team can play an expressive, exciting style of football, which is something we have lacked for the last two seasons for the most part. with manuel pellegrini steering the ship and a slew of new signings all eager to impress, i hope that the team will finish comfortably in the top half. greatest fear: i suppose the fear with spending nigh on £100m on new recruits this summer already is that they fail to live up to expectations. while all new additions have made names for themselves either abroad or in the lower leagues, with the exception of jack wilshere and lukasz fabianski, none of them have premier league experience and it's always a worry whether or not they can adapt to our game. key player: the club-record signing of felipe anderson from lazio immediately makes the brazilian our most important player heading into the new campaign. the exciting winger comes with great expectation to finally fill the void left by dimitri payet some 18 months ago. his playmaking ability in the final third is key to our progression under pellegrini. one to watch: following last season's breakout campaign, declan rice will be looking to move from strength to strengthen and further establish himself as a first-team regular going forward. despite signing two new centre-backs, west ham see a bright future for rice who could see some more playing time as a holding midfielder this season given the rearguard investment and subsequent failure to recruit an experienced holding midfielder thus far this summer. good window? it's been nothing short of an excellent transfer window for the hammers. seven new additions so far and no major departures. manuel pellegrini and mario husillos appear to be on the same page when it comes to identifying potential signings and squad evaluation. one or two players will be moved on and one or two more will be brought in, but the squad is in a very good place. away trip you're looking forward to: from a fans perspective, i relish the opportunity to travel to any and all away games, but there are a handful i have earmarked personally. visiting new grounds is always something i look to do, and after being unable to go there last season, trips to brighton and huddersfield are both on the agenda this season. the best away trip i've been to would be liverpool, but as you would expect, it's all heavily dependent on the result. i look forward to being at anfield on that opening sunday. where will you finish: the minimum expectation is a top half finish this season. i think the top six is a step to far at least for this season, but i look around at the other clubs in that tier below, and i strongly believe that in manuel pellegrini, west ham have the best and most experienced manager outside of the top six, and a squad to rival anyone elses. i think eighth is a realistic projection for this season. wolves ben husband (wolves fancast) biggest hope: that the team continue exactly where they left off last year. nuno's wolves adapted to the championship like a duck to water and all at molineux will be hoping they do the same to the premier league. greatest fear: that some of europe's elite really take notice of what could be happening at wolves and take some of our prized assets both on the field and in the dugout. key player: willy boly - although ruben neves rightfully gains a lot of the plaudits, wolves' promotion was built from the back. nobody bettered the 24 clean sheets achieved and the tall french defender was integral to that success. one to watch: ruben vinagre - heads were turned when assist machine barry douglas was sold to leeds, but the young portuguese left back has a huge future ahead of him and will now look to make a name for himself up against some of europe's elite. good window? this has been a summer of evolution rather than revolution. much of the business has been to tie last season's loan players on permanent deals and with the signings of internationals like rui patricio and joao moutinho, this summer can be seen as a massive success. away trip you're looking forward to: spurs - its a new ground for all fans to tick off and wolves have had some happy memories away to tottenham and they will be hoping to make some more in their luxurious new home. where will you finish: 8th\",\n",
       " 21: \"can anyone topple manchester city? how will arsenal fare in their brave new era? and will jose mourinho ever learn to love paul pogba? fresh from the world cup in russia, martin keown and chris sutton debate the burning issues ahead of the new premier league season.\\xa0 sportsmail's james restall asked the questions... keown: liverpool have city’s card marked. they were the first team to beat them in the premier league and saw them off twice in europe. what they lacked was the consistency to mount a title challenge but have spent a fortune to close their 25-point gap on city. i feel jurgen klopp is on a journey. i played against the liverpool sides of the late eighties and they would steamroller their opponents, particularly at anfield. that is what klopp’s teams do. i recently watched the excellent bbc documentary shankly: nature’s fire. his teams played for the people and it is the same with klopp. he is wired in to the emotion of the merseyside fans. he has strengthened every compartment of his team. andrew robertson and virgil van dijk filled the gaps in defence. now he has added quality in midfield with naby keita and fabinho and spent a world-record fee for a goalkeeper. toppling pep guardiola will take some doing but city’s goal will be to win the champions league. so fierce is the competition that i cannot see one team winning both the league and european cup. there is not the same pressure at anfield. maybe, just maybe, this could be their year. sutton: city won’t rack up 100 points but the title is staying at the etihad. i just cannot look past their strength in depth. john stones looked right at home at the world cup and he ended the season as city’s fourth-choice centre back. leroy sane, one of their most lethal weapons, has had his feet up all summer. he’ll be desperate to show why germany should have picked him. city’s football is breathtaking. their players know what it feels like not just to be champions but to utterly dominate and guardiola won’t take his foot off the pedal. do liverpool know how to beat city? yes. will their spending make it a tighter title race? yes. are they consistent enough to topple city? i’m not so sure. keown: i wish someone could help mourinho hold his tongue. he has invited this scrutiny by drawing attention to his team’s poor performances. it’s only pre-season! arsenal beat psg 5-1 but no one is saying they will be champions. working for someone who is never satisfied is difficult. mourinho’s personal quest for greatness seems to be suffocating his players. pogba was excellent in the world cup final but could have easily been dropped after a below-par display against australia in the group stage. didier deschamps stuck by him, backed him and he grew through the tournament. from day one at chelsea, mourinho said frank lampard was a world beater - and he then started playing like one. united have a formidable group of players but mourinho needs to learn how to love them. sutton: i said recently that if jose mourinho carries on with these outbursts, he is in danger of being out of a job before christmas. manchester united have gone from runners-up to complete turmoil. he’s been telling us that his side aren’t good enough, moaned about the lack of signings and risked upsetting paul pogba. how can anything positive come from this? united are the side most in danger of dropping out of the top four. if they get off to a bad start there will be more infighting, more moods, more outbursts and that is only going to end one way.\\xa0 keown: it may be all change but there will always be expectation. unai emery is a successful manager who is not here to finish fifth. i’m not saying they are ready for a title challenge but the top four has to be the objective. i’ve been impressed with emery. he has worked his players hard in pre-season. arsenal’s away form was embarrassing but they will have a better balance this year. they have a warrior in sokratis while lucas torreira can bring bite to the midfield. unlike their rivals, arsenal only had one player in the world cup semi-finals. city had seven. when they travel to the emirates on sunday the likes of kevin de bruyne, kyle walker and raheem sterling may be unavailable. arsenal will not have a better chance to beat the all-conquering champions. do so, and they could steal a march on their rivals. sutton: the top four will be their goal but the europa league may prove the more attractive route into the champions league.\\xa0 emery won the competition three times with sevilla, and arsenal don’t look stronger than last season’s top four. sixth is not good enough for this club. even if they finish in that position again, the season will still be viewed as a success if performances improve. keown: it will be a massive help. they don’t want to be at wembley for any longer than they need to be. opening the new ground against liverpool will be great theatre. the stadium will have a galvanising effect on the club. sutton: tottenham dropped just four points in their last season at white hart lane and this ground will become a similar fortress. the only thing i don’t get about the stadium is the microbrewery and artisan bakery. what’s wrong with a good old pie and pint? keown: managerial change is commonplace at chelsea but after arriving with only a month to go until the start of the season, maurizio sarri has it all to do. not only have his squad had little time to adapt to his 4-3-3 system, most of chelsea’s world cup stars have only just returned. should it all click they will be mouthwatering to watch. antonio conte is a serial winner but his side had become too predictable. sarri has huge experience but he’ll need to use all of it if chelsea are to hit the ground running. sutton: chelsea’s season hinges on eden hazard. he is so influential and wilfried zaha at crystal palace is the only player whose departure would be as damaging for one club. hazard was unplayable at times last season. should he leave, getting back into the top four will be an uphill struggle. once again, roman abramovich will be expecting chelsea to push but i cannot see sarri having the same instant impact as conte two years ago. keown: if i was one of our world cup stars, i would cut my holiday short. stones had an excellent tournament but had only played twice for manchester city since march. he faces stiff competition from nicolas otamendi, aymeric laporte and vincent kompany for a place. sutton: i saw ruben loftus-cheek has already gone back to chelsea. he knows it is on the training pitch where he can prove that he should be picked ahead of jorginho, n’golo kante and cesc fabregas.\\xa0 managers will go for the players who they believe give them the best chance of winning. it’s up to the english players to show why they deserve to be selected. which hot-shot will win the golden boot? keown: kane is the safe bet but don’t rule out arsenal’s pierre-emerick aubameyang. he scored 10 in 13 after joining in january and posted similar figures to kane in his last three years at dortmund.\\xa0 sutton: if harry kane stays fit it’s no contest. what makes him so difficult to face is that he is always one step ahead of the defenders. he now scores as many goals with his left foot as his right. i can’t see mo salah repeating last season’s extraordinary numbers. to remain as prolific then, like kane, he must keep developing his game.\\xa0 finally... predict the top four\\xa0 keown: i’m going to put my neck on the line and say liverpool to win it, followed by city, spurs and united. but arsenal and chelsea can sneak in. sutton: city will win the title with liverpool second. it’s too close to call between the next four but tottenham will finish third and united fourth... just. \\xa0keown 1. liverpool 2. manchester city 3. tottenham 4. manchester united\\xa0 \\xa0sutton 1. manchester city 2. liverpool 3. tottenham 4. manchester united\\xa0\",\n",
       " 22: \"there will be a time, probably in the first game of the premier league season, when fans will be waiting for var to correct a perceived injustice. they'll be making the tv signal in the stands and on the sofa at home! except, var isn't there. i've been asked if the premier league have missed a trick by not implementing video technology, especially as it was so well received at the world cup. but they are right to wait another 12 months. a good referee does not make a good var referee, and the premier league need to find both and give them more experience. one of the big concerns from last season was the time it took to review decisions. the premier league did not want to spoil the flow of the game, because this league is the fastest in the world.\\xa0 i get that, but if you look at the world cup, it did not feel as if the reviews impacted on the game. there was a time towards the end of the group stage when var was coming in for a bit of criticism. but after the reversal of an offside decision to award south korea a goal in their 2-0 win over germany, attitudes changed, with the pundits in the tv studios and at home. it added to the drama of that game, and it was the correct call. i want to see the system become more transparent though. the decision should be shown on a big screen in the stadium and i want to hear what the referees are saying to each other. by the time var comes into use in the premier league, i hope the transparency is there. for now, we have to wait — it will definitely be worth it. stop shirt-pulling\\xa0 where do you start with shirt-pulling in the penalty area? well, you start by referees stamping it out without the need for var. the best referees will have studied the players they are refereeing and should be aware of tactics such as shirt-pulling and blocking from set-pieces. give a warning before the corner or free-kick has been taken and then no player can complain if you award a foul. var was a deterrent at the world cup, leading to more space and more goals from set-pieces. good referees should do the same by making players aware they are on to them. in the early weeks we will see referees being extra vigilant. but let's not go from one extreme to the other. remember, a lot of the time the attacker is holding the defender just as much as the reverse. i want to see referees being brave enough and clever enough to make the obvious calls, because that will lead to more goals and more entertainment - and that's what we all want to see.\\xa0\",\n",

never are while spurs will be this season's big surprise and not in a good way. they have not invested properly and could suffer because of it. it's a shock to include leicester to go down but they

       " 24: \"it is the sort of scenario they may well present to a budding manager during assessment for his coaching badges - what to do if your team is reduced to 10 men after less than quarter of an hour? oh, and it's your first ever league game. and it's away from home. this, however, was far from the comfort of the classroom for steven gerrard. at a partisan pittodrie, this was for real. the former liverpool and england captain thought he had the answer - put your two pacey wingers through the middle, play on the counter-attack, nick a goal, defend your lead and escape back to glasgow with an opening-day victory. and how close the rookie boss was to emerging with top marks. indeed, aberdeen's first shot on target did not arrive until the 92nd minute - it just so happened to find the bottom corner via the boot of a teenage debutant who had not read the script.\\xa0 for gerrard, after impressively negotiating two europa league qualifiers in recent weeks, this was his first setback. interestingly - and somewhat surprisingly - he did not react to it with the good grace you would expect of an individual so intelligent and considered. by the time he came to reflect, the club tie which had completed his suited ensemble had been ditched. perhaps he had used it in an attempt to string up the referee and his assistants, for they were the source of his ire. yes, his frustrations were not entirely without justification, but to suggest a wider conspiracy against his new club after his first scottish premiership match in charge match was baffling and deflected from his team's courageous performance. 'it's not just today, it's been happening for a good while,' said gerrard.

'we feel hard done by because we felt he was provoked twice with violent barges,' said gerrard. 'no way in the world was his kick out violent. so we didn't think he deserved a red.' gerrard wasn't done there with the officials. after reshuffling his team and pairing wingers josh windass and jamie murphy in attack, the clear instruction was to drop balls in behind centre-backs mckenna and michael devlin, whose turning speeds were akin to one of those nearby north sea oil tankers. how satisfied gerrard must have been, then, when his side were awarded a penalty on the half hour after breaching aberdeen's static backline before windass was tugged to the ground by dominic ball.\\xa0 'there was no attempt to play the ball. so it's beyond me how a card can't be shown for that situation.' said gerrard. was he right? aberdeen boss derek mcinnes did not think so and opinion among observers was split, too. either way, captain james tavernier scored from 12 yards and gerrard allowed himself a discrete fist-pump - after events of the first 30 minutes he could take nothing for granted. and so it proved when 19-year-old bruce anderson smashed beyond allan mcgregor from inside the penalty area in injury-time. that was the afternoon's big injustice - not the refereeing - and gerrard rightly reflected: 'i thought we were better than aberdeen with 11 men and 10. we looked like the team with all the ideas, we looked like we wanted to play the right way. 'tactically we were spot on for the majority of the game. so i don't go away from here sad, i actually loved what i saw.' there wasn't much love for the officials, however.\\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

'it's been happening for a good while. i believe it's been happening for seasons. that's my opinion, just my opinion.

'i think when you do stuff like that, when you react like that, you leave officials with decisions to make,' acknowledged the rangers boss. 'so we will speak to him about the part he has played in it. but we feel hard done by because we felt alfredo was provoked twice with violent barges. no way in the world was his kick out violent. so we didn't think he deserved a red. 'at the same time, with the penalty there was no attempt to play the ball.. so it's beyond me how a card can't be shown for that situation. 'the rules state that if you don't make an attempt to play the ball, you should be punished. there was no punishment. i had a chat with the ref. 'the assistant said he only saw one second out of the three with the alfredo incident, which i find hard to believe. 'there are always emotions straight after the game. we've got a long journey back to reflect and decide on it. it seems like the world is against us today. but we'll make sure we get better for that. 'we'll make sure we play better and try and put results to bed, because it looks like some more decisions will go against us as the season goes on.' motionless when morelos was sent off after 12 minutes, the former liverpool and england captain approached the officials for an explanation after the game. asked if opponents were targeting the temperamental colombian in a quest to have him sent off he added: 'possibly. so he needs to learn and be ready for that. 'i can't prove that's the case but two violent barges by mckenna, it seems people are out to wind him up, yeah. 'what's disappointing from our point of view is that the whole incident was two or three seconds but the assistant only saw one second of it. 'so he sees alfredo's instant in one second but not the two barges in the other two seconds.' delighted with his team's display after they bounced back from the morelos red card by restricting aberdeen to scraps, gerrard claimed: 'i thought we were better than aberdeen with 11 men and better than them with 10 men.\\xa0 'we looked like the team with all the ideas, we looked like we wanted to play the game the right way.

       " 28: \"steven gerrard will have walked into pittodrie on sunday morning expecting a really difficult test. by the time he left a few hours later he must have been thinking: 'what was all the fuss about?' on the evidence of what we saw, rangers will cruise past aberdeen into second place this season. they were so comfortable - even with 10 men. in the first 10 minutes, ryan jack was the orchestrator, in the way scott brown does for celtic. then came the red card for alfredo morelos and, suddenly, we were watching the first major examination of gerrard's credentials as a manager. he tweaked things to play without a striker, stay solid and hit aberdeen on the counter, which they did to good effect. gerrard got the better of aberdeen boss derek mcinnes. in his first real test as rangers manager, he passed with flying colours. but i'm not sure about what he had to say after the game. does he honestly think referees have a vendetta against his club and his players? it's nonsense. talking about incidents in the past is irrelevant. it's the here and now that matters - and you can't have a player going around kicking people. that's what morelos did and he was rightly sent off. it wasn't a bad decision. okay, it was a bit soft but the colombian gave the officials a decision to make. gerrard has gone from being a player, to a pundit, and now to a manager in the space of 18 months. he might have made those kind of comments as a pundit, but he wouldn't have made them as a player. and he shouldn't be making them as manager of rangers, it doesn't reflect well. he is picking a fight he doesn't need to pick after a game in which his team played really well. you need hard evidence to back up comments like that. you can't just go around making wild accusations. it's wide of the mark to suggest referees have it in for rangers - or any other team, for that matter. he is a new manager, at a new club, with lots of new players - he should be focusing on the future. celtic aren't talking about the invincible treble a couple of seasons ago. they are talking about trying to qualify for the champions league. gerrard said afterwards that he was delighted with his players and that they played the perfect game - that should have been the story of the day. but the back pages on monday morning will be covered with what he said about referees and the implication that there is an agenda against rangers. it's ridiculous. they were down to 10 men for almost 80 minutes but were so solid that they limited aberdeen to just one real effort at goal. other than that, allan mcgregor didn't have to make a single save. that highlighted how poor aberdeen were on the day. gerrard is a smart guy. he will know the dons have finished second for the past four years in a row - and only nine points behind a dominant celtic team last season. on the evidence of sunday, he'll be thinking: 'you know what - we have a real chance here if we can keep progressing in this manner'. listening to what gerrard and the rangers players said in their post-match interviews, you could sense their belief. it was a case of: 'we are better than aberdeen -plain and simple'. and it showed. the dons were really poor. they looked a bit leggy having gone to extra-time at burnley in midweek. but that's no excuse. the top sides can pick themselves up and go again when it comes to balancing european football and the league, celtic have done it for years. mcinnes will know the enormity of the job he has on his hands this season in terms of maintaining the level they have been at over previous years. they still have a lot of work to do in terms of recruitment and i would love to see louis moult back in the premiership. mcinnes tried to sign him from motherwell last summer and he is the type of striker who could make a real difference. if aberdeen really want to be competitive, they need to bring in someone who is going to get them around 20 goals a season. the same things keep cropping up with alfredo morelos. we know he can score goals. but, a lot of the time, it's his attitude, petulance and immaturity that ends up being the talking point. he is still just 22, but you can take a lot from what pedro caixinha said about him last season. caixinha basically made the point that, if he was an opposition manager or player, he would do everything he possibly could to wind morelos up and get under his skin. everyone will be encouraged to have a go at him - because they know the red mist can fall at any moment and he'll lash out. that's what happened on sunday it wasn't a case of the referee sending him off - it was morelos who got himself sent off by kicking out. scott mckenna had a little go at him. but so what? it's part and parcel of the game and you have to learn to deal with it. you are going to get physical contact and a bit of needle with defenders - but you can't just go around kicking them. morelos needs to get his head straight and start focusing on scoring goals because we saw last season that he is really talented. some people were saying that this could be the end for him at rangers after what happened on sunday but it's too premature for that. steven gerrard obviously feels like it was harsh and he will try to put an arm around him and protect him. if i was a player and i had someone like gerrard sitting me down, having a chat and telling me to do something - that's exactly what i'm going to do in the next game. if he listens to his manager, morelos could be a top player for rangers. if he doesn't, he'll spend a lot of time suspended in the stand, which is absolutely no use to them. celtic have a tricky tie against aek athens. i always preferred to play the second leg of these european games at home. it gave you an extra edge, knowing what you need to do. celtic look like they are in a really good place in terms of their mentality and how they approach games. the only worry is this will be a huge test for the young guys in the back four - certainly a massive step up from rosenborg. kristoffer ajer and jack hendry are clearly good players with huge potential but they will be tested to their maximum. athens are a decent side. they reached the last 32 of last season's europa league - and drew 0-0 with ac milan in the san siro along the way. going to greece next week in need of a result might be a big ask given the away record in recent years.\\xa0 so celtic need to really blow them away in the first leg in glasgow - which they are fully capable of if they produce their best football.\",\n",

       " 41: 'this is more like it. this is more like the bold, exciting and imaginative approach we were supposed to be getting when the apparently adventurous joe root replaced the seemingly conservative alastair cook as england test captain. it did not work out that way last year when a selection panel that appeared to be following a different agenda to coach trevor bayliss - who kept on advocating jos buttler - picked uninspiring players like gary ballance and liam dawson. now everything is different. new national selector ed smith, a surprising choice by andrew strauss ahead of the favourite andy flower, has been a revelation in picking 20-year-olds dom bess and sam curran and ‘white-ball specialists’ like buttler and adil rashid. now comes his boldest move yet. ollie pope, another 20-year-old, has made only 15 first-class appearances and has never appeared in the top five in championship cricket but has been picked by smith and company to replace no 4 dawid malan for the second test. when the white smoke appeared over england’s birmingham hotel yesterday smith, his new sidekick james taylor, bayliss and root had selected the latest exceptional young player to emerge from surrey’s conveyor belt. and the mood appears to have rubbed off on root who, frankly, has been a disappointment as captain so far but who led the team impressively at edgbaston, especially on a last morning where he did everything right. pope will now join his fellow oval protege - edgbaston man of the match sam curran - and there are more to come, like their team-mates amar virdi and ryan patel, from the academy of the championship leaders who are setting the example for english cricket to follow. ‘ollie has made an exceptional start to his first-class career and has been the division’s standout batsman this year,’ said smith. ‘the panel believe ollie’s performances and character suggest he is well suited to international cricket.’ he has certainly looked the part in making 684 runs in the championship this season at an average of 85.50, which includes three centuries and a top score of 158 not out. he also impressed with an unbeaten half-century for the england lions against india a before the first test, which confirmed his place ahead of another exciting young batsman, worcestershire’s joe clarke. what’s more, a young player who emerged first as a wicketkeeper before an outstanding last year at cranleigh school two years ago has been picked as much on character as on his prodigious batting ability. ‘we would do a lot of sessions on the bowling machine with him wanting the speed up to at least 90 miles per hour, 10 or 15mph quicker than it would be for most good schoolboy players,’ pope’s former director of cricket at cranleigh, stuart welch, told sportsmail. ‘he’s spent years developing his paddle scoops and ramp shots. originally i thought he would be marked down for one-day cricket but he has come on rapidly in all forms of the game. ‘it’s interesting that he really hasn’t played much club or second-team cricket. in the past surrey haven’t always been as keen to give chances to younger players so alec stewart deserves a lot of credit. i think last winter in australia helped him too. ‘ollie’s temperament is excellent. he’s deeply competitive but he’s also a decent and humble sort of lad who has time for other people. he played a full part in the school outside cricket.’ it was while pope was in australia playing grade cricket for campbelltown last winter that he even came to the attention of the new south wales parliament, with local mp and club stalwart chris patterson commending him in the sydney house.\\xa0 ‘off the field he has been an absolute gentleman and a wonderful role model,’ said patterson. praise indeed from an australian. now the question will be where pope fits into smith’s brave new world. the absence of ben stokes through his appearance at bristol crown court creates the usual question of balance with chris woakes, brought into the squad for stokes, and moeen ali effectively competing with the surrey youngster for two places. it is unlikely pope would bat higher than six in stokes’s place, which would mean perhaps moeen at five or as high as four if england do not want to move jonny bairstow. and if woakes misses out it would mean england having only three seamers, with curran backing up stuart broad and jimmy anderson. whatever combination england come up with, bayliss knows they cannot allow their thrilling first test victory to camouflage the problems that still haunt them. ‘it will be interesting to see who can step up and take stokes’s place,’ said bayliss after saturday’s 31-run win. ‘someone will have to put in the extra yards. we have things to work on, batting-wise and catching-wise. hopefully we’ll have that confidence at lord’s.’ england (v india at lord’s): root (capt), ali, anderson, bairstow (wkt), broad, buttler, cook, curran, jennings, pope, porter, rashid, woakes.\\xa0 \\xa0',\n",

'you do feel the years go by,' she said. 'major opportunities come once year and you put it all on the line and if it doesn't go well then you wait an entire year for the next chance at a major medal. like i say, you do feel the years going by when it's like that. 'i feel i am coming towards my peak opportunities in the next three or four years. i used to think tokyo 2020 would be my main one but maybe it will be 2024. maybe then i will go for a single event but i am going year by year.\\xa0 'the next few years are important but i do believe i haven't my potential yet.' the strength of thiam, who is two years younger at 23, has complicated the landscape, of course. 'she has achieved everything i want to achieve,' johnson-thompson said. 'people are not bigging her up too much at all - i hope people big her up because if i had done what she has done i would want people to talk about me in that way. 'i used to think if i was top of my game in every event then no one could beat me but thiam has better pbs added up than me. i have had to reassess my life a little bit after the 7,000 points she got last year but i do believe i am still able to get pbs. 'i'm looking forward to going against her. she's a great athlete and a really nice person but i know from experience that anything can happen in a heptathlon.'\\xa0 from her training base in southern france, the confidence for berlin has only been spoken in muted terms. the calf injury put her behind 'where i wanted to be at the start of the year', but then again she can satisfied with two gold medals by april and a shot at a third in august. 'i'm always going for more,' she said. 'i have not arrived yet so i need to push on.' it will take some shove to dislodge thiam. live tv coverage begins on monday on bbc and british eurosport.\",\n",

'he got me good. but nothing (significant enough) that i wasn't there,' he told joe rogan after the fight. just when it looked as though garbrandt had his foe hurt, however, dillashaw fired back landing two right hands that knocked the challenger to the ground. he trapped garbrandt's arm as he turtled up, landing elbows. he continued to swarm garbrandt as he got back to his feet, connecting with a big knee that spelled the beginning of the end for garbrandt. in the co-main event, cejudo ended the longest title reign in ufc history with a split decision win over demetrious johnson, calling on the wrestling skills that won him an olympic gold medal to get the job done in the rematch. following what will be remembered as the greatest title fight in the history of the weight division, cejudo called for a showdown with the winner of the main event. 'the winner of this next fight, i want to fight that guy. dj didn't go up. i'm going up! i want that belt too!' said cejudo in his post-fight interview. in the early exchanges, cejudo appeared to roll his ankle, which caused him some trouble as johnson pressed forward and chipped away at his lead leg. after chasing much of the opening 10 minutes, he scored a takedown at the end of the second round. having had success with his wrestling, the olympic gold medalist repeated the strategy in the third and fourth rounds; he successfully took 'mighty mouse' down towards the end of the fourth after taking the brunt of the damage in the striking back and forth. cejudo threatened with multiple takedowns in the final round in the face of johnson's leg kicks. the duo finished out the epic battle exchanging with each other in the pocket as the final bell sounded. meanwhile, renato 'moicano' carneiro called for a rematch with brian ortega following his first-round dispatch of perennial title contender, cub swanson. the promising brazilian pushed his stock to a whole new level as he dropped swanson with a jab before finishing him with a rear-naked choke. speaking after the win, 'moicano' urged the ufc to give him a chance to avenge the sole loss of his career. he was winning on the judges' scorecards before ortega finished him with a patented guillotine in the final round of their featherweight clash two years ago. earlier, jj aldrich highlighted a weakness in jiu-jitsu expert polyana viana's game as she outstruck her to win a unanimous decision, handing the brazilian her second career loss in the process. aldrich, who is a training partner of strawweight champion rose namajunas, forced viana to pull guard in a effort to get the fight on her terms late on. aldrich's willingness to clinch with the grappling ace underlined her confidence, even though she entered the bout as an underdog. ranked veteran thiago santos proved too much for newcomer kevin holland in their entertaining middleweight contest, which opened the event's main card. holland's unorthodox offence caused the brazilian some difficulty over the 15 minutes. at one stage, the debutant attempted a jumping omaplata and showcased some slick sweeps in the second round and reversed position with a kimura. santo's aggressive ground and pound likely won him the nod on the judges' scorecards. he waded in on his opponent every time he took top position, and was the clear winner after three rounds brett johns showed tremendous heart despite dropping his second consecutive decision, this time to highly ranked brazilian, pedro munhoz. the welshman fought valiantly even though he was dropped on several occasions with body shots and chopping leg kicks. he evaded munhoz's patented guillotine on several occasions, and no doubt won a lot of fans with his gritty display.\",\n",

       " 82: \"read all the very latest news with our transfer centre pre-season 2018: check out your club's fixtures and results keep up-to-date with every premier league transfer deal completed \\xa0  keeping on top of all the new premier league kits released throughout the summer is not as easy as it used to be. long gone is the era when teams only had two strips and even the home kit lasted two seasons.\\xa0 now you can expect around three new kits every summer and they add up stretched across 20 teams. so keep track with them all as they are released with our guide and verdict on all the designs coming to a premier league ground near you soon...\\xa0 home kit it's a new era at arsenal and while they hope for success under new manager unai emery, arsene wenger's replacement cannot be at fault for its messy looking start. arsenal's first home strip under the emery has, at best, received mixed reaction from gunners supporters and it is easy to see why. you arguably have to go back nearly 25 years for the last time arsenal featured as much white on the shoulders and sleeves combined. done correctly it should not have been a problem but the thin red stripes on the sleeves do nothing to compliment the design. should the good times come rolling back it may become a cult classic, otherwise this one won't be fondly remembered. home kit verdict: 5/10\\xa0 away kit if arsenal supporters are not happy with their home shirt then they may take comfort in a slightly better offering with their away strip. granted, it is not the most striking kit produced for the gunners in recent years but there will be far blander shirts released this summer, and it does look a touch better than the similar looking 'dennis the menace' strip from 2007-08. away kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 third kit pop quiz. what links arsenal's away strip and their third kit? the answer is herbert chapman and his wm formation from the 1930s. confused? take a closer look at the strips. while the away version has an 'm' stitched into it, the third kit has the attacking concept of the formation with the 'w'. whether that gimmick is enough to win over arsenal fans to the club's first green kit since 1983 is another matter. we've certainly seen worse though. third kit verdict: 7/10 home kit and away kit it's brighton, it's blue and white stripes but there is still a big departure from last season's strip. the blue shoulders have made way for white, while the actual stripes are thicker. not exactly groundbreaking stuff but it is at least a different offering from nike. there's a retro twist to brighton's away kit which is all green as a tribute to the strip won by the club when it was under the guise of brighton united between 1898-99. home kit verdict: 7/10 away kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 home kit ah, the old switcheroo trick from umbro, in football's laziest attempt to add some form of change to a team that play in stripes. this time it is red that features as the central stripe colour on bournemouth's home kit, but at least there are a few added tweaks elsewhere. all black sleeves and limited gold trim are a nice addition to what is otherwise a standard cherris home shirt. home kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 away kit no thrills from bournemouth regarding their away strip for next term as they opt for a fairly simple white kit with navy shorts. small details include stripes stitched into the kit and salmon pink trim on the sleeves - which seem more like an umbro advertisement than anything else. it does the job of providing alternate colours to the club's traditional colours but that won't stop it becoming a forgettable kit by the time next may comes round. away kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 third kit forget the away kit, bournemouth - you won't be needing that anytime soon. that is because in the third strip the cherries have all they need. the beach glass colour (no seriously, that is what it is called) looks striking with its tonal pattern on the front of the chest, making the away design looking even more bland than it already is. one negative is perhaps the third strip needed a darker colour to really draw it away from the away kit, but we can let good designs bypass this issue. thumbs up to the team at umbro. third kit verdict: 8/10 home kit the chances are burnley will not be able to match their heroics last season when they stunned just about everyone to finish seventh - or as it is now called - best of the rest. so how do puma celebrate what looks like being the major high point of their recent history? by releasing a new home kit that is close to identical as last season's strip. that's not even the worst part. gambling sponsorships tend to make a shirt ugly anyway but when more than one language is squeezed onto a kit, it makes you start thinking of how long it will be before football shirts take a similar look to racing driver overalls. home kit verdict: 5/10\\xa0 away kit compared with the rest of the premier league away kits this really is not that special, yet this may still be burnley's best strip available this season. the black kit features a honeycomb print which becomes more prominent lower down the shirt and adds some form of design to what otherwise would have been a boring old black kit. puma have ignored trying to weave it into the shorts but for the average fan buying it that is not going to be a problem. away kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 third kit due to their europa league qualifier with aberdeen, burnley were forced to rush out the unveiling of their third kit. and by the look of things, puma were forced to rush out a design for it too. it's white with a hint of...well, white and complimented by... even more white. throw in that horror show of a sponsor logo and you have one of the most boring and worst strips released this summer. not even a tonal 'v' on the front is saving this. third kit verdict: 4/10 home kit an all-blue kit may seem typically cardiff city, but this is a whole different look to the one adopted by the welsh outfit from the last time they were in the premier league four years ago. this time there is no red kit nonsense or the hysteria around it, but compared to last season there is hardly any difference at all. not necessarily a bad thing and there is a slight difference in terms of the this year's kit featuring a subtle two-tone showing of blue hoops. otherwise this is pretty much the same cardiff kit since they ditched project red. home kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 away kit no massive design changes on the away strip either for cardiff city, with adidas offering a similar template to that of the home strip. it being a grey kit with a standard template should make this kit rubbish, but that is not the case. the blue trim compliments the strip well, and the minor additions of thin grey stripes helps lift the kit out of blandness. not bad. away kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 home kit\\xa0 it's not very often you see a splash of design on a chelsea strip, but maybe nike have found just the right balance for the 2018-19 season. the blues' new home kit maintains the key details - blue shirts and shorts with white socks - but it's the invasion of the trim colours on the front of the strip that raises the eyebrows. the subtle but certainly noticeable white and red stripes that flash across the front and reverse of the kit certainly mark a departure from safe and simple in the design stakes. red may have last featured on a strip as recent as 2016 but it doesn't happen too often these days. fans are divided but at the very least it blends in well with the sponsor logo... home kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 away kit chelsea's away strips over the last two or three years have been rather bland with its selection of black and whites. so the return of yellow to the strip is very much welcome, even if it is to just add some colour to the west london side when they are on the road. it looks very similar to the kit worn during the title winning 2014-15 campaign, and seeing as its their best away design since then, you wonder why they bothered to change it at all. away kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 home kit crystal palace are more liberal than most teams that feature two predominant colours when it comes to mixing up their home kit, and 2018-19 will prove another change of direction. stripes remain, and of course they are red and blue, but the cut of them is thicker. in addition the red stripe will gradually fade to blue going down the shirt. yellow trim helps compliment the finish, with puma's first kit for the club proving innovative and it has been well received by fans. it's just a shame about the ugly sponsor. home kit verdict: 8/10 away kit not only have puma pleased palace supporters with their home kit but they have done the double with a classy away design too. for a certain generation it may as well be the home kit, as palace played at selhurst park in white strip with a red and blue sash from the mid 1970s for nearly a decade. there was no need to make stylistic changes like with the home shirt and as a result the eagles have two excellent strips for the new campaign. away kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 home kit not much went right for everton over the 2017-18 campaign but there is hope for the toffees that brighter days lie ahead in the new season. for a start, supporters are sure to be delighted with their new home strip. but then considering it was made as a result of a fan consultation it is hardly a surprise. umbro collaborated with fans to understand their preferences on colour, collar and other design features. as good as the finished article looks, it is odd to see the diamond umbro template make a return to the sleeves. it was last seen on a strip that was worn when everton were incredibly fortunate not to be relegated in 1998. home kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 away kit everton have dabbled with pink a couple of times in the last decade but on this occasion it does not do enough to salvage an otherwise bland away strip. grey is hardly the most inspiring of primary options for a colour on an away kit and it is not lifted much by the black sleeves that accompany it. the pink trim is a welcome feature and prevents the kit being flat out boring, but unless the toffees end up wearing it in a 6-0 thrashing of chelsea at stamford bridge it is unlikely to be well remembered, and more likely soon forgotten. away kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 home kit fulham are back in the premier league and to celebrate a return to the top flight, adidas have produced a home kit for everyone to celebrate like it is 1999. the late 1990s saw the start of the cottagers' rapid rise up the ranks that would eventually lead to them getting promoted to the premier league in 2001. the strip from the 90s had a hooped feature across the front and they are now back for the first time since those heady days under kevin keegan and then later jean tigana. it's a pizza hut logo short of completing that whole memorable journey of that period but either way it is sure to go down well with supporters. home kit verdict:\\xa08/10 away kit the home kit is where the originality ends for fulham though, as they have been given an away strip that shares identical templates to many other clubs. it actually looks good with the white trim complimenting the various navy blue colours on the display. then someone stuck a big yellow betting logo on the front of it. stick with the home shirt. away kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 home kit same old for huddersfield right? blue and white stripes job done. well not exactly. umbro have hardly pushed the boat out in terms of design, but they have not had to. for the first time in almost 50 years the terrier will appear on the club badge and that is worthy enough of a reason to give an old huddersfield favourite a traditional design and colours. home kit verdict: 7/10 away kit much like the home kit, no chances have been taken by umbro with what is being called an 'alternative strip' as the tried and trusted red and black show off the change colours. last season's retro design has been shelved before it makes a possible reintroduction for the 2038-39 season following its next orbit in the retro kit stakes. so for now its just the home kit template with familiar away colours. good enough for terriers supporters but nothing to excite a casual. away kit verdict: 7/10 home kit a new team is behind the latest leicester city strips for the 2018-19 season, with adidas supplying the foxes for the first time in their history. you would not have guessed that too easily though looking at the new home kit, which in truth has hardly changed at all since that premier league title winning campaign in 2015-16. the only notable alteration to the shirt sees white adidas stripes replace the puma gold on the shoulders alongside a v-neck collar. otherwise, the socks have a touch more white in what is another all-blue kit. nothing to turn the heads of outsiders but it should be a hit with foxes fans.\\xa0 home kit verdict: 6/10 away kit this looks like being the standard adidas away kit template for the season, as the design is exactly the same as cardiff city's who unveiled their away strip earlier in the summer. the only differences then are the slightly darker grey colours, the orange trim and of course the monochrome leicester badge which would not have been a good look on a cardiff shirt. otherwise this review should probably have just read 'see cardiff'. away kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 third kit already having a standard templated away kit, adidas have sadly not offered much improvement on making a third kit for leicester. admittedly there is not much to really criticise. the foxes have always had white as a traditional away colour and the blue shoulders at least steer the design away from just being an all-white bore. but third kits offer a chance for a bit of flair and adidas have failed to accept the challenge. third kit verdict: 7/10 home kit there are not too many ways you can change an-all red kit but in a world where the commercial arm of football clubs demand at least two new strips to sell every year, liverpool seem to year-on-year get the balance right. no shocks once more with the home strip. it's red, albeit judging by the promotional pictures a slightly darker shade than usual. trim remains white along with the club badge that featured in yellow for the 2017-18 campaign. a stylish buttoned collar is a welcome addition and back for the first time in five years. no thrills stuff but no complaints either. home kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 away kit what is it with new balance, and formerly warrior? why do they have to keep releasing these garish away strips for liverpool that even the 1990s would turn their nose up at in disgust. this is not the worst of them from over the years but it would look much more at home as a training top or even a goalkeeper's shirt. the only explanation is that former mexico keeper jorge campos has sneaked his way into the design team at new balance. either way, thumbs down. away kit verdict: 4/10 third kit now that is more like it from new balance who have somehow managed to add some style to the the concept of a white and grey strip. it was a pretty simple solution but it was to model liverpool's third strip off the kits from the 1980s, although not going as far as actually copying. the third kit is subtle, and stylish and more than makes up for the purple monstrosity. third kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 home kit believe it or not there is almost always a change to the predominant colours in a manchester city kit and this summer's is no different. it comes in the socks which will switch from light blue to navy - in homage to the double promotion winning seasons and to return to the premier league in 2000 and the club's first top flight title in 1937. city fans will not want to be reminded that on both occasions, relegation followed a year later. not that we are suggesting pep guardiola's side are going down next season. there is more chance of city fans embracing the champions league anthem and singing along with high acclaim for uefa. this is a well designed strip though from the slightly darker trim on the arms to the added button on the neck. city are not only the team to beat on the pitch but in the fashion stakes too. home kit verdict: 9/10 away kit nike are often accused of 'phoning it in' when it comes to designing kits but their latest away strip for manchester city is proof that they can deliver the goods when they are not too busy playing on the ping-pong table near their work desks. apparently this strip is a nod to the kit that earned them promotion from the third tier back in 1999. colours aside, it looks nothing like it but that does not matter because with pin stripes and a pair of ultra bright socks begging to be caked in mud, this is a belter. away kit verdict: 9/10\\xa0 home kit brave move form adidas. they could have quite easily have just designed a plain red shirt, stuck their stripes on to provide a return of black trim to manchester united, then sit back and count the incoming coins.\\xa0 but by putting a train track graphic on the shirt in reference to newton heath origins (whatever happened to the green and gold protests?) to mark 140 years (not a milestone) adidas may have a gone a step too far here.\\xa0 the gradual fade to black down the front of the shirt merges well with the black shor...wait, black shorts! united playing with a red shirt and black shorts combination has been done many times before but only as a change alternative. so since changing the name to manchester united in 1902, this will be the club's first ever season without white shorts. it's a brave new world at united, top marks to adidas for trying but have they gone too radical with this? home kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 third kit manchester united are a club steeped in history and tradition and they've honoured that with the unveiling of one of their new strips for next season. the red devils will go back to blue for the 2018-19 campaign when they wear their third kit with a design inspired by the 50th anniversary of the club's historic first european cup win. the red devils wore blue in their defeat of benfica to become the first english side to win european football's biggest club prize. the gold trim is a stylish touch and as a bonus blends with the sponsor logo. united often produce strong change strips and this is another of those. third kit verdict: 9/10\\xa0 home kit we get it, newcastle play in black and white stripes and that is sacred. so on that note it is a little harsh to criticise puma for a lack of ideas for a new home kit. but when the only solution offered is to change the shoulder colour to white and the order of the stripes on the front of the kit it feels rather lazy. the biggest departure on the whole strip is the change to white socks, otherwise what is the point? home kit verdict: 6/10 away kit it's been nearly a quarter of century since we were dazzled by kevin keegan's 'entertainers'. and while newcastle fans these days have the manager in rafa benitez they want to bring back the good ol' days of the mid-1990s, they don't look like returning to the business end of the premier league anytime soon without serious financial backing. but there is a crumb of comfort for toon supporters, with the away kit for the 2018-19 season a near copy of the hooped design worn during the 1995-96 premier league campaign when they narrowly missed out on the title. it might not have the likes of david ginola and les ferdinand playing in it, but it is one of the best strips you will see in this campaign. only a silly betting company logo prevents perfection here. away kit verdict: 9/10 third kit so how do you top that away kit? well quite simply you don't and puma know it. the only way in providing a third strip that will gather any sort of attention is to splash it in an outrageous shade of blue and hope for the best. and you know what? those folks at puma have pulled it off. third kit verdict: 8/10 home kit under armour are in their third season supplying southampton kits now and credit where it is due, have resisted the urge to just simply go through the usual motions of switching the colour of the red and white stripes. in fact last season they ditched the stripes all together. but it is back to familiarity for saints fans as the stripes return complete with an all-red shoulder and sleeves combo. it is not groundbreaking but it is acceptable looking and wildly different from the previous season. therefore a thumbs up from us. home kit verdict: 7/10 away kit officially, this kit takes 'inspiration' from the strip worn in the 1976 fa cup final victory over manchester united. that is a bit cheeky from southampton as it is no closer to the kit than their many other yellow and blue strips released from over the years. still, this is their first yellow and blue change strip in the premier league since 2005 and if we have learnt anything from the swedish national team and to a slightly lesser extent italian side parma, it is very hard to get a yellow and blue kit wrong. away kit verdict: 7/10 third kit and so southampton become the first team to release their new home kit for the 2019-20 season, with a...wait this is a change strip? now admittedly, and rather frustratingly this is a good design from under armour and one might have thought with a few tweaks they could have banked it and released it as next season's home strip instead. but nope it has been relegated to third strip status and as a 'change kit' offers very little change at all to the home shirt aside from the absence of white stripes. what a waste. third kit verdict: 6/10 home kit tottenham hotspur were the last team to unveil a new kit ahead of the 2018-19 season but this is not one of those cases of saving the best to last. admittedly, the way the shirt blends into the shorts is a nice touch but as a stand alone shirt it looks rather tacky. the average spurs fan has a dilemma. risk the tacky look or match it with the shorts and walk into dangerous territory of being a full-kit-wa...wally. the team does not fully escape the problem. in europe spurs play with white shorts, so unless the club release a dedicated european kit (don't rule it out, someone has to pay for the stadium) the club are going to have a rather messy strip in the champions league next term. home kit verdict: 6/10 away kit now spurs have the opposite problem to that of the home kit. as a stand alone shirt this is not a bad looking away design. the lighter blue shoulders are a neat addition to the navy strip but that is where the compliments end. the shoulder colours carry over to the shorts and socks appear even lighter. many responses on the unveiling compared the kit to looking like pyjamas. so if tottenham are caught napping on their travels next term, you have a go to excuse already made spurs fans. away kit verdict: 6/10\\xa0 home kit watford have often been an accumulator breaker for many punters since gaining promotion to the premier league  with their wild inconsistency. how many sides go unbeaten at the start of the season before losing 6-0 at home against manchester city?\\xa0 so adidas have celebrated this wild contrast by giving the hornets a black and yellow striped kit for the new season. unprecedented? not quite. there was the more garish thin hoops on their premier league return in 2015 but a more suitable link would be the decade between 1914 and 1923 when they wore black and white stripes. if a team that played in stripes all the time produced it, this would be boring. but this is a radical step on a watford strip and it looks the part. home kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 away kit it's the same adidas template which will feature on many premier league away kits this term, yet watford may have the best of the bunch. managing to avoid the drab grey as a primary colour, the all-green strip features various shades. it's something different from adidas, even if its skeleton is just the same as everything else out there. the big bonus for watford fans was every supporter who attended an away game last season picked one up for free. a nice offer and probably the least they deserved having travelled to watch their team score only once on the road in 2018. away kit verdict: 8/10\\xa0 home and away kits the template for a west ham kit was easy to follow for umbro. mainly claret but with plenty of blue too. where in that memo it got altered to just plain claret shirt with a touch of blue trim is anyone's guess. admittedly it is aesthetically not too bad - a little bland - and what perhaps saves umbro is that west ham have played in kits in the past with only a touch of blue - albeit rarely. the navy blue away strip although a similar design comes across a lot more acceptable... until you see the yellow socks. home kit verdict: 7/10 away kit verdict: 6/10 third kit if the world cup taught us anything it is that white change kits have become a bit of a football trope in recent times. granted, this strip is more of a hint of grey, with faint claret and blue patches on the shoulders at least offering some form of uniqueness. it's not exactly eye-catching, but we can at least forgive the claptrap about the kit being inspired from the early 1990s due to the fact that at\\xa0it looks a lot different to the other two kits this season... doesn't it southampton. third kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 home kit wolves are back in the premier league after storming to the championship title last term but it's all change in the aesthetics front for the molineux outfit. no don't worry wolves fans, it is not a sudden change of direction where the team plays in blue and white stripes and adopts a\\xa0throstle as part of the badge. instead it sees adidas move in, and their first major change is to see the club restore a more traditional\\xa0 golden colour to their strip. it is a simple change to a simple kit - but it will be a winner among fans. home kit verdict: 7/10\\xa0 away kit when you play in gold and black, the need for an away kit is not all that great. but a team needs one anyway, and besides why miss out and let every other club try and rinse supporters dry for up to three replica kits? onto away strip matters though, it really is a sort of nothingness like many other white away kits even if it is just the west midlands club's second in the last decade. away kit verdict: 5/10\\xa0\",\n",
       " 83: 'after the most exhilarating night in his young life and, indeed, the recent history of english football, we might have expected jordan pickford to be crawling the walls and running on adrenaline. he had saved brilliantly to deny colombia\\'s carlos bacca and seal england\\'s first ever world cup penalty shootout win, yet as the country went completely potty, the everton goalkeeper\\'s night was disarmingly routine. he did not lie in bed reading the internet praise and watching back videos of that crucial save. as mum sue and girlfriend megan waited with hordes of family and friends to embrace him, pickford was even unable to see his loved ones. \\'it was actually all relaxed after the game,\\' pickford recalls. \\'i was up for drug-testing, so i couldn\\'t even go and see my parents and my missus! then we flew straight back to the base camp. \\'i went straight to sleep. i have only seen it back once or twice. i am not lying there watching it. it\\'s nice to look at but it\\'s about looking forward, getting on to the next victory. my phone went completely nuts, though. ridiculous. my instagram followers have gone up though!\\' pickford lets out a grin. for the 24-year-old england no 1, this has been a life-changing summer. he saw the mighty tv viewing figures and the videos of beer flying through the air in fan parks, from his native north east in sunderland to the south east in croydon. in the half-hour sportsmail spends in his company, his new life emerges as one of posing for selfies with children, sending happy birthday video messages and reliving the mighty summer of 2018.\\xa0 taking the long and lonely walk from the halfway line to the goal for the shootout, pickford shunned memories of past england failures. \\'the truth is i get more nervous doing interviews like this! football doesn\\'t bother me. i just enjoy it. it\\'s when you have to go to clubs and sing and do initiations and all that stuff. that\\'s when i get nervous. \\'i felt ready. we had done our homework. every penalty i had the same routine and i did it exactly how i wanted to do it. i felt very relaxed and felt like i could make it happen for the country. i would think there is less pressure on the goalkeeper than the taker. but i was quite high up in the queue to take one. i would be confident. i know exactly where i would go... but i\\'m not telling you!\\' \\'the reaction was amazing. we did our bit and put smiles on people\\'s faces. that\\'s what international football should be about. i want to play for england for as long as i can. there is no better feeling. the gaffer believed in me. but you only get one chance in football. i had to grasp it.\\' it should be remembered that pickford had only three caps before the world cup. during his first england meet-up a year earlier, captain wayne rooney sent a photograph of pickford to the goalkeeper\\'s former sunderland team-mate george honeyman with the caption: \\'he hasn\\'t said a word!\\' pickford smiles as he recalls: \\'it\\'s going to be daunting, isn\\'t it? going on the england bus for the first time as a young lad, sat next to the top goalscorer in english history and the captain at the time. who wouldn\\'t be nervous? \\'i was sat opposite him and jordan henderson. wayne was an amazing person to learn from. he always had time to pass on his insight and he texted me during the world cup with support. rooney was not the only senior england international to get in touch. joe hart sent him good-luck messages, even after he had learned he would not be part of gareth southgate\\'s squad. there was scepticism over southgate\\'s choice to place his faith in pickford. after straight-forward matches against tunisia and panama, the spotlight burned more brightly on the goalkeeper when he conceded a goal against belgium, as adnan januzaj\\'s curling effort eluded his grasp. gary neville said on itv: \\'the goalkeeping\\'s a bit strange. he goes with his wrong hand. his feet are up in the air.\\' lee dixon backed neville\\'s view. belgium goalkeeper thibaut courtois then said a taller goalkeeper would have stopped the strike. pickford smirks. \\'my mental side of the game is really strong. it doesn\\'t affect me. anyone can slate me if they want to. i know if i have played well or badly. i always ask my dad and he tells me straight. other people don\\'t affect me. it\\'s just about me becoming better. i still call my old goalkeeper coach, mark prudhoe at sunderland, and he\\'s very honest with me. \\'on adnan\\'s goal, it\\'s instinct. you have a split second. it\\'s like boxing. if you go with a left hook, he might come over the top and surprise you with a right hook. my reactions are good. it was such a small margin and if i had saved it, everyone would have been saying, \"what a worldy save!\" people will criticise me because i am on the top stage. but that\\'s where i want to be. it was an unbelievable effort by adnan... it\\'s just a pity he couldn\\'t do that when he was at sunderland!\\' the criticism stirred pickford. from there, his performances became more dominant and eye-catching with every knockout fixture. against colombia, he also made an astonishing fingertip save seconds before the south american side drew level. there was then a collection of stops against sweden in the quarter-final and he made an outstanding save at the feet of mario mandzukic in extra-time against croatia. \\'i spread myself really well for that croatia one,\\' he says. \\'i grew up watching peter schmeichel videos, so there may have been some of that there. as a sunderland fan, i loved tommy sorensen. i watched football but i was a kid who really preferred being out on the street with my mates playing hide and seek! that\\'s me - a bit daft! i was out playing football every day on the tarmac, diving to make saves. \\'as a keeper, you need every tool in the box. you can be technically great but it\\'s all about keeping the ball out the net. you need guts. mark at sunderland used to say the job is keeping it out, however scruffy or technically perfect it may be.\\' pickford partly appeals to managers due to his versatility. he adapted to sam allardyce\\'s more traditional expectations of a goalkeeper with the same poise he demonstrated in southgate\\'s progressive system. his calmness on the ball set the tone and he, like england\\'s centre backs, retained ice-cool detachment on the ball, even as pressure mounted. new everton manager marco silva will likely have a similar approach. \\'you have to adapt,\\' pickford says. \\'growing up at sunderland, i was always involved in possession and outfield work. under big sam, i could kick it for miles if he wanted me to kick it long. he also taught me about game management. \\'i have played nearly 200 league games - i have more experience than most people think. the lower leagues were such a help for me - i had loans at places like alfreton and darlington. i was taken out of my comfort zone, being battered by strikers at corners. \\'i loved those saturday 3pm games, hearing every word from the terraces. it was more brutal than the premier league because you heard every last word people said about you - in big stadiums it\\'s just noise.\\' pickford\\'s form has triggered speculation of a move, with chelsea reportedly interested. but his focus is on everton, where he returned from holiday on friday and is targeting a top-six finish. he says: \\'i just chilled out and went to greece with my missus. the season is just round the corner so i have cut my holiday short. manager marco silva texted me a few times in the world cup and i\\'ve spoken to our new goalkeeping coach. i feel fresh and i want to improve.\\' for everton and england, that can only be good news. jordan pickford was speaking at the launch of mcdonald\\'s uk\\'s new football sponsorship programme. for further information visit www.mcdonalds.co.uk/football ',\n",
       " 84: \"not content with becoming manchester city's all-time top goalscorer, sergio aguero is continuing to set records at the etihad stadium. the argentine has now broken into the 200 club after netting the opener in the community shield against chelsea on sunday. he later upped his tally to 201 with the second goal of the game. the goals mean he is now part of a select group to have notched a double ton for a single club in english football, joining a host of legends in the game. most recently it was wayne rooney who joined that list on his way to 253 goals for manchester united. before the everton striker there was frank lampard, who reached 211 goals at chelsea, and thierry henry, the only player to net over 200 times for arsenal. alan shearer netted the last of his 206 goals for newcastle in 2006, a total bettered by one by matt le tissier at southampton.\\xa0 aguero is now the 27th player from a current premier league club to have surpassed the 200 goal mark for a single side. dixie dean leads the way having scored 383 times for everton between 1925 and 1937, way ahead of ian rush's haul of 346 just over half-a-century later across stanley park. liverpool and manchester united both have four players each to have scored over 200 times, including such legendary names as roger hunt, billy liddell, bobby charlton and denis law. 1. 548 goals -

       " 85: 'after 22 years, a new manager will grace arsenal’s technical area when the club begin their premier league campaign at home to champions manchester city at the emirates stadium next sunday. arsene wenger is out and unai emery, formerly of paris saint-germain and sevilla, has been anointed as his successor. for arsenal supporters, there will be a tinge of nostalgia for the wenger era but also excitement as the new regime gathers pace. here adam crafton reveals the secrets of emery’s revolution, underlining where the spanish coach could shine and why he could yet be undermined by the uncertainty festering in the boardroom. eye for detail emery’s dependance on lengthy video analysis sessions is legendary among his former players. the spanish winger joaquin once joked emery made him watch so many clips that he ran out of popcorn — and the meetings have started in earnest during arsenal’s pre-season tour. emery and his coaching staff spend a combined 12 hours editing information that is then presented to players in a condensed 30-minute format. david villa, who played under emery at valencia, has also been managed by vicente del bosque, pep guardiola and diego simeone. ‘i always liked emery’s approach,’ villa said, in el maestro, romain molina’s authorised biography of emery. ‘unai always wanted to make a player better and analyse the opposition point by point so that players have all the information they could wish for. i am grateful for everything he did for me.’ new greek defender sokratis papastathopoulos said that remedial work on the team’s ‘organisation’ began from the very first day, after arsenal contrived to concede 73 goals in all competitions last season. emery has also renewed the focus on set-pieces. juan mata, his former valencia player, says emery is the manager with the highest concentration on set-piece routines and when you consider that the manchester united playmaker has played for rafa benitez, jose mourinho and louis van gaal, it is a statement that speaks volumes for emery’s attention to detail. curiously, emery’s assistant juan carlos carcedo has also plucked certain routines from basketball during his career, in a manner reminiscent to gareth southgate and england this summer. the intensity of emery and his coaching staff is not to everyone’s liking. in france last season, it was reported that superstar neymar found the video sessions too gruelling, while hatem ben arfa was caught on camera telling carcedo: ‘you yell too much! just let us play.’ french newspaper l’equipe also suggested that the assistant’s criticism on the training ground lacked ‘human warmth’ and became too ‘virulent’ for some players. yet, as hector bellerin pointed out last week, a new-found structure may be just what arsenal require. the defender said: ‘arsene wenger was a manager that led a lot of inspiration from the players. he gave you a lot of freedom. unai emery is a bit more tactical. we are going to be more organised on the pitch.’ during their week in singapore, arsenal only had one high-intensity tactics session, with the focus predominantly on building fitness and conditioning. but emery is now accelerating the squad’s development to instil a fast pressing system that will bring his side up to speed with the premier league’s most modern and progressive sides, such as manchester city, liverpool and tottenham. goalkeepers petr cech and bernd leno will be asked to take higher starting positions, while the team will be expected to press as a pack to recover possession. arsenal will likely line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, but it becomes a 4-4-2 without the ball and mesut ozil in the no 10 role will be told to lead the pressing along with the central striker. the early reaction from the players has been positive and emery has also held repeated individual talks with players. they know they have a modern manager who has three europa league titles to his name — and a fourth this season would represent a mightily fine first season. the personal touch under wenger, the arsenal squad became accustomed to learning the team’s starting line-up in the days leading up to the game. it was usually the day before, but sometimes even earlier. emery is more determined to keep players on their toes, taking the view that every player must be ready on match-day. for pre-season matches, players have been informed of the starting xi on the day of the game. throughout his career, emery has striven to develop close personal relationships with players. he has been buoyed by having the vast majority of his star names at his disposal for much of pre-season, while the likes of jose mourinho, pep guardiola and mauricio pochettino stagger through to the campaign with patchwork sides. those early devilish fixtures against manchester city and chelsea now represent an opportunity to catch their opponents cold. emery’s command of english is improving with regular lessons and he is also encouraging his spanish-speaking staff to talk among themselves in english. his female language teacher has even sat pitchside during training sessions to offer support to emery if he feels it is required. the manager is determined to succeed in the premier league, having bided his time for the correct offer and previously resisted approaches from west ham and everton. emery has also been known to focus on individual players during pre-match team-talks, where he lists bullet points on a whiteboard but livens it up with stories plucked from the arts. on one occasion at sevilla, he even invited the club kitman to speak. emery has a record of recommending books to his players, with mata often asking for tips when the pair were together at valencia, while molina’s biography also reveals that emery gave his sevilla goalkeeper sergio rico the autobiography of victor valdes to aid him through a difficult phase. rico’s father later thanked emery for the intervention. the coach also reveals himself to be an admirer of daniel goleman’s work on emotional intelligence and terry orlick’s volumes on psychology and leadership. he has also read recent books about guardiola and diego simeone, while he still keeps tactical works on mourinho from the manchester united manager’s time in portugal. board uncertainty following the long-awaited departure of wenger, the new concern at arsenal is the increasingly doubtful future of chief executive ivan gazidis. the ceo has an offer from ac milan and informed the arsenal board at the end of last month that he is considering a change. the suggestion in italy is that gazidis will link up with milan at the end of the transfer window. it is peculiar timing. gazidis won his long-running power battle with wenger and has placed himself at the front and centre of this new arsenal era. when wenger departed, gazidis attended the press conference in the immediate aftermath.\\xa0 the executive then sat beside emery, his choice as manager, at the spaniard’s unveiling. gazidis has shaped the club’s new structure, with raul sanllehi lured from barcelona as head of football relations and sven mislintat brought in as head of recruitment from borussia dortmund. at the club’s london colney base, gazidis made a speech introducing the new manager and, on the tour of singapore, gazidis addressed staff, players and coaches at a club barbecue in a passionate defence of ozil after the german retired from international football. he has spoken to emery almost on a daily basis since the coach arrived and the spaniard will now be keen to make a strong start in the premier league if one of his strongest advocates is to depart so rapidly.',\n",
       " 86: 'it was the summer when the world cup in russia helped us fall in love with international football again but on friday the premier league is back to reclaim its place in our affections.\\xa0 here is a wishlist of 10 things to keep it at the top of the game. 1. jose mourinho was a great manager and he may be a great manager again but his relentless self-pity and his raging narcissism became tedious a long time ago. he was indulged, up to a point, when his teams were winning titles but his petulant behaviour on manchester united’s tour of america this summer was almost as dull and predictable as some of the football he has been inflicting on united’s supporters over the past two seasons. i hope this is the season when united rid themselves of his yoke, preferably before players such as anthony martial and paul pogba move to escape him, and hire a boss who can treat old trafford to the kind of vibrant, attacking, energetic football that is in vogue elsewhere in the division. the world cup reminded us that football is supposed to be fun but more than ever mourinho seems intent on sucking the life out of the game. 2. in defiance of the prophecies that it would usher in anarchy at the world cup, var was a success in russia. the measured, intelligent way it was used proved that the premier league was mistaken to bow to the hysteria that greeted its every implementation in the fa cup last season by blocking its introduction in the league this season. so i hope that when the moaning begins this season about decisions that hard-pressed officials have got wrong, clubs remember the feeling of injustice long enough to make sure they do not delay any more and introduce the system ready for next season. the premier league are supposed to be leaders in our game. right now, the absence of var makes them look like troglodytes. 3. the reaction to neymar’s pathetic histrionics for brazil during the world cup was another indication that the public have run out of patience with the antics of some players and the epidemic of attempted deception in the game. sure, there are worse things in football: bad tackles that can end careers; swinging elbows that can shatter bones. but it is more and more obvious the efforts to feign or exaggerate injury are affecting the enjoyment of supporters. i hope this season that players who persevere with these antics are laughed out of town as neymar has been. maybe then, we will find a cure. 4. i am not a liverpool supporter but i am a fan of much that the club stand for and of their manager, jurgen klopp, and everything he brings to the premier league. he is part of the new wave of managers in our top flight whose intensity and zeal and love of the game trail enthusiasm and enjoyment behind them. klopp has spent big in the transfer window and there is a consensus that he needs to win a trophy to justify the outlay. so i hope a liverpool team that look like a side capable of fashioning a challenge for the title pick up a prize. the longer klopp sticks around in england, the better. 5. there are too many vanilla palaces to excess in the premier league; too many stadiums that have been turned into libraries; too many stadiums where the prawn sandwich brigade hold sway, where the idea of an intimidating atmosphere is but a distant memory. i hope the new spurs stadium, scheduled to stage its first home league game in the middle of next month, is an antidote to all that. the stadium certainly looks the part. its magnificent design is an indication that it might just be the kind of cauldron that will make it into one of the most stirring arenas in english game. 6. the criticism aimed at paul pogba last season because of the way he chose to have his hair cut was one of the more curious features of the premier league campaign. it is time, surely, that we moved beyond appearance when trying to judge a footballer’s performance on the pitch. when i was at edgbaston for the first test on friday, i consulted former england coach and renowned expert in modern manners, david ‘bumble’ lloyd, on this very matter but his belief that footballers should be restricted to short back and sides and only allowed tattoos that say ‘mum and dad’ or depict an anchor did not quite chime with my own. 7. amid all the positivity that surrounded england at the world cup, it was still obvious that gareth southgate’s side lacked a strong, creative influence in midfield; a player who can surge past a man; a player with the vision to thread a killer pass; a playmaker; a christian eriksen; an eden hazard; a luka modric. how encouraging it would be if we can start to remedy that this season by giving english players more game-time in our top league. in russia, southgate referenced the fact that only a third of players in the premier league are english, thus reducing his talent pool drastically. if jack wilshere, at west ham and ruben loftus-cheek, at chelsea, played more regularly this season, that would be a start.\\xa0 if phil foden began to feature for manchester city, that would be even better. the more eligible players who appear in our top division this season, the better southgate’s chances of building on the successes of volgograd, nizhny novgorod, moscow and samara. 8.\\xa0the ugliest thing i saw last season was the harassment of referee michael oliver by then juventus keeper gianluigi buffon in the champions league quarter-final against real madrid.\\xa0 different competition, sure, but the tendency of players and managers to blame officials for their own mistakes is still commonplace in the premier league, too. this season, wouldn’t it be refreshing if players and bosses started to take responsibility for their own actions. if they don’t, it’s time to come down much harder on dissent. 9. maybe it’s of limited interest to fans but it would be a step forward if the thaw in relations between the england team and the media that took place over the summer could be replicated in the premier league. yes, that makes journalists’ jobs easier and more pleasurable but the other lesson from what happened in russia is that it helps to present players as three-dimensional beings rather than distant figures hidden behind the tinted windows of 4x4s. southgate knows most players are ordinary, decent lads with inspiring stories to tell. it’s just that most of the time, they’re not allowed to talk. the more forward-thinking clubs grew more open some time ago but there are plenty still stuck in a dark age of suspicion and misinformation. 10. i enjoyed watching manchester city last season as much as any title-winning team i have seen. but i hope the race for the title is closer this season because, for all city’s brilliance, it’s no fun when the title has effectively been won by christmas. city are still the team to beat but liverpool will press them more closely than united were able to last season. my prediction for the top four: 1. manchester city 2. liverpool 3. chelsea 4. manchester united. one final wish for the new season: i hope my predictions get better, too.'}"
